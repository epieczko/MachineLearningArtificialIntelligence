Risk aversion is shaping another tough day for Wall Street, with stocks trading in the red as investors await the presidential debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, scheduled at 9 p.m. ET.

Energy and financial sectors are witnessing deeper losses, sharply underperforming the rest of the market.

In the latest monthly report, OPEC revised its global oil demand growth forecasts downward, now expecting 2024 oil demand to increase by 2.03 million barrels per day (bpd), down from the previous estimate of 2.1 million bpd. For 2025, OPEC has trimmed global demand growth forecast to 1.74 million bpd, compared to the earlier projection of 1.78 million bpd.

On the regulatory front, Federal Reserve Board Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr announced changes to the BASEL III and GSIB (Global Systemically Important Banks) surcharge proposals, which will now increase capital requirements for the largest banks by 9%, down from the original plan of 19%. Barr also clarified that banks with assets under $250 billion would largely be exempt from these heightened requirements.

Despite this capital relief, financial stocks sank across the board. The financial sector gauge fell 2%, with JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) dropping 7%. The SPDR Regional Banking ETF (NYSE:KRE) declined 2.6%, reflecting ongoing pressure even on the regional bank industry which is largely exempted from the regulation.

Elsewhere, Treasuries continued to rally. The iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT) rose 0.6%, hitting its highest levels since late July 2023.

The Japanese yen gained 0.5%, while both gold and Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) traded broadly flat, reflecting a mixed sentiment in alternative assets.

Semiconductor, hardware, and artificial intelligence-linked stocks led by Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) are down as the sector continues to pull back.

AI stocks led by Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM) selloff continue their downward price trajectory as the Nvidia and Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) quarterly prints failed to impress the Street.

Broadcom released its third-quarter earnings on Thursday. The topline grew 42% to  $13.07 billion in the third quarter, topping the analyst estimate of $12.96 billion. The chipmaker expects fourth-quarter revenue of $14 billion, above the analyst consensus of $12.70 billion. The adjusted gross margin grew by 110 bps sequentially and 230 bps year-on-year to 77.4%.

JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur projected upside, citing robust AI growth, VMware momentum, and recovery in traditional semiconductor sectors.

Last week, Nvidia’s second-quarter topline grew 122% to $30.04 billion, surpassing the analyst estimate of $28.68 billion. It expects third-quarter revenue of $31.85 billion-$33.15 billion versus the analyst consensus of $31.77 billion. The adjusted gross margin declined 320 bps sequentially and grew by 450 bps year-on-year.

BofA Securities analyst Vivek Arya maintained a bullish outlook backed by data center and AI training demand and supply chain recovery.

VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH), which tracks the overall performance of the 25 largest U.S.-listed companies that produce semiconductors, including Nvidia, Taiwan Semiconductor, Broadcom, and AMD, has been down 12% in the last five days. iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) fell 12% in the previous five days.

Nvidia has been down 15% in the last five days. AMD lost over 10%, and Taiwan Semiconductor lost 8%. The selloff refused to subside despite assurances from contract chipmakers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) regarding sustained AI demand.

ProShares Ultra Semiconductors (NYSE:USD), which corresponds to two times (2x) the daily performance of the Dow Jones U.S. Semiconductors Index, lost 26% in the last five days.

ETFs with exposure to riskier indexes noted volatility during the period. ProShares UltraShort Semiconductors (NYSE:SSG), which corresponds to two times the inverse (-2x) of the daily performance of the Dow Jones U.S. Semiconductors Index, gained 28% in the last five days.

The ETFs tracking broader indexes like the S&P 500 and NASDAQ saw relatively lesser value losses due to Big Tech stocks like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).

Investors showed little enthusiasm for the August jobs report, as the slower-than-expected hiring numbers deepened worries about a softening labor market.

The U.S. economy added 142,000 nonfarm jobs in August, up from July's 89,000 but falling short of the projected 160,000. The unemployment rate edged down by 0.1% to 4.3%, in line with expectations, while wages saw stronger-than-anticipated growth, rising 0.4% month-over-month.

On Friday, markets shifted sharply into risk-off mode, with all major indices dropping over 1% by midday trading in New York.

The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) spiked over 17% to 23 points. The Nasdaq 100 led the decline, losing over 5% for the week, eyeing its worst performance since September 2022.

Semiconductors dragged down the tech-heavy index. The iShares Semiconductor ETF (NYSE:SOXX) dropped nearly 5%, while Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) fell more than 4%. The chipmaker giant extended the weekly loss to 14%, on track for its steepest decline since October 2022.

Investors dumped equities and moved into cash as the U.S. dollar strengthened despite weaker-than-expected nonfarm payroll data.

In the bond market, short-term Treasury yields tumbled, bringing the yield curve back to a normal shape after two years of inversion. The two-year Treasury yield fell below the 10-year, signaling a shift in economic outlook.

Commodities took heavy losses across the board. Gold dropped 0.9%, silver plunged 3.1% and crude oil (WTI) slid 3%, reaching $66 per barrel, the lowest since May 2023.

Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) also dropped, losing over 3%, as investors steered clear of crypto assets amid a broad-based decline in risk appetite.

The U.S. Treasury market rallied sharply on Friday after August labor data showed weaker-than-expected job growth, bolstering bets on Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.

The U.S. economy added 142,000 nonfarm payrolls last month, an increase from 89,000 in July but missing the expected increase to 160,000. The unemployment rate ticked down by 0.1% to 4.3% as expected, while wages displayed higher-than-forecasted growth.

Market-implied odds of a 50-basis-point rate cut in September surged to 61% as of 11:05 a.m. in New York, overtaking the 39% probability of a 25-basis-point cut, according to the CME Group‘s FedWatch data.

September Rate-Cut Probabilities After August Jobs Data

September Rate Cut Now* 1 day ago (Sept. 5, 2024) 1 Week ago (Aug. 30, 2024) 50 basis points (0.5%) 61% 40% 30% 25 basis points (0.25%) 39% 60% 70%

* Data as of Sept. 6, 2024 11:05 a.m. ET, CME FedWatch

Traders poured into bonds amid growing expectations of declining interest rates, driving yields sharply lower across the Treasury curve.

The policy-sensitive two-year yield dropped over 10 basis points, reaching 3.59% at 11:15 a.m. in New York, its lowest level since March 2023.

The 10-year Treasury yield fell 6 basis points to 3.67%, marking its lowest point since June 2023.

This movement has led to a positive slope in the Treasury yield curve from the 10-year onward, effectively ending the more than two-year period of yield curve inversion.

Market Reactions

Rate-cut expectations and falling Treasury yields triggered sharp moves across asset classes, with bonds rallying, the dollar weakening against the yen and equity markets sliding.

“No sooner than the payroll print hit, the algorithms marched into high gear, pushing Treasury yields lower as the disappointing headline number, coupled with a series of downward revisions, suggested a more dire economic backdrop perhaps requiring a heavier dose of Fed medicine on Sept. 18,” said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial.

Markets are wrestling with whether the August payroll data signals a labor market returning to pre-COVID norms or an economy losing critical momentum, Krosby said.

Treasury-related ETFs surged, with the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT) rising 1.1% to $100.65, on pace for its highest close since late July 2023. The Japanese yen strengthened as well, with the Invesco CurrencyShares Japanese Yen Trust (NYSE:FXY) gaining over 1%, poised to close at its highest level since early January 2024. Volatility spiked, as the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) jumped 14% to 23. Wall Street flipped to the red, with the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) dropping 1.5% on Friday, extending its weekly decline to 3.9%, on track for the worst weekly performance since March 2023. Tech stocks were hit hardest, with the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) down 2.4%, pushing its weekly loss past 5%. Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) tumbled 4%, extending its weekly loss to 14%, its worst performance in two years.

Signs of a cooling labor market last month pushed major U.S. stock averages lower on Thursday, ahead of the highly anticipated August jobs report set for release on Friday.

Private sector job creation came in at 99,000 for August, according to ADP data, marking the slowest pace of growth since January 2021 and missing the forecast of 140,000.

A stronger-than-expected services sector activity sentiment for August offered some relief to broader recession concerns, but an employment subindex bolstered hints of the ongoing cooling in the labor market.

The S&P 500 dropped below the 4,500 support level for the first time since mid-August, extending weekly losses to 2.9%, and is on track for its worst week since mid-April.

Tech stocks managed to pare losses, with semiconductor shares holding steady. Blue-chip stocks underperformed, as the Dow Jones slid 0.8%, while small-cap stocks fell 0.6%.

A decision from OPEC+ to delay an October oil production increase by two months supported crude prices and further pressured already fragile investor sentiment. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude stopped its decline after suffering its worst two-day slump since October 2023.

Treasury yields dipped slightly, and the U.S. dollar softened. Meanwhile, gold edged higher by 0.6%.

Natural gas was Thursday's standout performer, with Henry Hub prices surging over 5%. The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported a natural gas storage injection of 13 billion cubic feet (Bcf) for the week ending Aug. 30, significantly below historical averages and expectations.

Sentiment in crypto assets worsened, with Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) tumbling 3% to $56,170.

The August jobs report is the week's most anticipated economic release as investors closely watch for signs of a rebound in the U.S. labor market following the recession-like figures seen in July.

The Employment Situation report for July revealed a significant slowdown in job creation, with total nonfarm payrolls dropping from 179,000 in June to just 114,000 in July — far below the expected 175,000.

Adding to the concerns, the unemployment rate unexpectedly rose from 4.1% to 4.3%, triggering the Sahm Rule, a well-recognized recession indicator that has successfully signaled every U.S. recession since 1970.

In response to July's weak data, the stock market experienced a sell-off, with the S&P 500, tracked by the SDPR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), dropping 1.9% on the day as investors flocked to safe-haven assets, reducing risk exposure amid recession fears.

What can investors expect from the August jobs report?

Sahm Rule: ‘This Time Is Different’

Bank of America forecasts an increase of 200,000 nonfarm payrolls for August, significantly higher than the median analyst expectation of 160,000, as per TradingEconomics.

The private sector is expected to add 170,000 jobs, with government hiring contributing an additional 30,000, according to Shruti Mishra, U.S. economist at the bank. She also anticipates that both the unemployment rate and the labor force participation rate will drop by 0.1%, to 4.2% and 62.6%, respectively.

Mishra highlighted two key aspects of July’s weak job report: “First, the majority of the rise in unemployed workers in July reflected temporary layoffs, likely driven by seasonal factors such as auto retooling volatility in Michigan. Second, the number of workers not at work due to bad weather surged from 59,000 in June to 436,000 in July,” she said.

Texas saw the largest increase in this category, largely due to the impact of Hurricane Beryl.

While the rise in July’s unemployment rate triggered the Sahm Rule — indicating a potential recession — Mishra said she is confident “this time is different.” She highlights that the Sahm Rule only flashed due to temporary, rather than permanent, layoffs.

Bank of America views the low payroll numbers in April and July as statistical anomalies, particularly given that the U.S. economy grew at an average annualized pace of 2.2% in the first half of 2024, the analyst said.

Yet there is also room to be cautious. “We see two potential downside risks to our August payroll forecast,” Mishra added. “The first is the impact of the California wildfires, and the second is that temporary layoffs from July could become permanent.”

Goldman Sachs Disregards July’s Recession Signals

Goldman Sachs has also distanced itself from the July unemployment spike and its potential implications for a recession.

David Mericle, U.S. chief economist at the bank, said the current labor market dynamics do not indicate a recessionary spiral, but rather a normal softening.

“We are clearly not seeing a layoff spiral, the fast-moving vicious circle of job and income loss leading to reduced spending and further layoffs that would be hard for policymakers to counteract,” he said in a report.

Trend job growth is currently running at around 160,000 per month, while job openings remain slightly above pre-pandemic levels, Mericle said.

“It would be odd if labor demand were suddenly weakening excessively because GDP is growing robustly,” he said.

Goldman Sachs also expects that signs of softening in the labor market are sufficient to prompt a gradual easing of interest rates. Mericle said he projects the Federal Reserve will enact consecutive 25-basis-point interest rate cuts in September, November and December, rather than the originally anticipated quarterly cuts.

The Goldman Sachs economist said he does not foresee any 50-basis-point cuts in the near term.

The first trading session of September started with a widespread selloff across risk assets, as traders took a cautious approach ahead of what is historically a volatile month for global markets.

At 1 p.m. in New York, the S&P 500 had dropped 1.6%, while small-cap stocks nosedived 2.7%. The Magnificent Seven, tracked by the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (NYSE:MAGS), offered no safe haven, declining 2.3%.

The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), often referred to as Wall Street’s “fear gauge,” surged by 20%, reflecting heightened anxiety among investors.

Tech stocks were hit hard, with the Nasdaq 100 down 2.5%, on track for its worst one-day drop since Aug. 1.

Tuesday’s selloff was reminiscent of the market turmoil caused by the unwinding of the yen-dollar carry trade earlier in the summer. This time, the yen jumped 0.8% against the dollar after hawkish comments from Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda overnight.

Despite the yen’s strength, the U.S. dollar gained 0.2% against a basket of other currencies, buoyed by broader market movements.

On the economic front, U.S. manufacturing data for August showed a deeper-than-expected contraction, with the employment index indicating mounting challenges ahead of a crucial jobs report due later in the week.

Treasury yields fell as the weak manufacturing data fueled speculation of potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The yield on the two-year Treasury note, which is sensitive to policy changes, dipped 3 basis points, while the 10-year Treasury note yield dropped 7 basis points. The iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT) rose 1.2%.

In commodities, gold prices slipped 0.5%, while oil prices plunged more than 4%, marking the steepest one-day decline since October 2023. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil fell to levels not seen since early January 2024, driven by concerns over weaker demand and expectations of increased OPEC supply next month.

Cryptocurrency markets also faced pressure, with Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) down 2.5% as overall sentiment remained weak.

Investors have many options when it comes to investing for retirement.

Among the available strategies are to invest in index funds, mutual funds, ETFs or choose individual stocks. Benzinga recently asked which of the Magnificent 7 stocks was the best option for retirement.

What Happened: The Magnificent 7 stocks, a select group of highly valuable and widely recognized investments, are often associated with high-growth financials and leading companies in the technology sector.

The Magnificent 7 stocks are Apple (NASDAQ:APPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).

“If you had to invest your entire retirement account into just one Magnificent 7 stock, which would you choose?” Benzinga asked.

Here are the results:

Nvidia: 33%

Apple: 21%

Microsoft: 17%

Amazon: 14%

Tesla: 7%

Alphabet: 4%

Meta Platforms: 4%

The results are hardly surprising given Nvidia’s status as one of the most talked-about growth stories in recent years, with the stock significantly outperforming over the past year.

Apple ranked second in the poll and comes as the company is among the top performers over the last five years and has a loyal fan base.

Why It’s Important: The Magnificent 7 stocks have outperformed the broader stock market over the last five years and 10 years based on the returns compared to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), which tracks the S&P 500.

Here’s a look at the five-year and 10-year returns of the Magnificent 7 stocks:

Stock 5-Year Returns 10-Year Returns Nvidia +2,962% +25,603% Apple +337% +822% Microsoft +200% +802% Amazon +95% +900% Tesla +1,291% +1,031% Alphabet +177% +451% Meta +180% +572%

For comparison, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF is up 92% over the last five years and up 179% over the last 10 years. Each of the Magnificent 7 stocks beats the ETF for both time periods, with many more than doubling its returns.

Nvidia recently topped a poll on which Magnificent 7 stock Benzinga readers would invest $1,000 in today. It was Amazon.com that topped Nvidia in a poll on which Magnificent 7 stock could best weather a recession.

For investors looking to get exposure to all the Magnificent 7 stocks, there is also the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (NASDAQ:MAGS) which holds the seven companies.

The study was conducted by Benzinga on Aug. 26 and Aug. 27, 2024, and included the responses of a diverse population of adults 18 or older. Opting into the survey was completely voluntary, with no incentives offered to potential respondents. The study reflects results from 112 adults.

Investors are increasingly eyeing the real estate sector with optimism as the Federal Reserve edges closer to initiating its much-anticipated rate-cut cycle.

Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) have emerged as a standout performer in August, leading the market in gains while also becoming a magnet for investor inflows.

Five out of the 64 U.S.-listed real estate exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have collectively pulled in a robust $2.2 billion in net inflows over the past month.

This influx of capital represents more than half of the total inflows that these ETFs have attracted over the entire past year, as market participants increasingly bet on the real estate sector to benefit from lower borrowing costs and more favorable financial conditions ahead of the potential Fed rate cut in September.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell, in his remarks at the Jackson Hole Symposium, signaled that the Federal Reserve might consider lowering interest rates soon due to a noticeable cooling in the labor market.

“The time has come for policy to adjust,” he said, adding that ""the cooling in labor market conditions is unmistakable.""

The Fed chair also expressed increased confidence that the economy is on a sustainable path toward the 2% inflation target.

5 Real Estate ETFs Attract Inflows As Investors Jump On Rate-Cut Winners

The iShares U.S. Real Estate ETF (NYSE:IYR) led the inflows, attracting $805.6 million in net investments over the past month—a sum that represents two-thirds of the fund’s total inflows for the past year.

The Vanguard Real Estate ETF (NYSE:VNQ) – the largest real estate ETF with $37 billion in assets under management – saw a strong recovery in August, pulling in $613.6 million and nearly offsetting its earlier outflows, bringing its yearly inflows close to breakeven.

Story continues

The Real Estate Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLRE) also experienced robust activity, with $498.6 million in net inflows over the last month.

Other notable performers included the SPDR DJ Wilshire REIT ETF (NYSE:RWR) and the iShares Residential and Multisector Real Estate ETF (NYSE:REZ), which attracted $146.7 million and $136.8 million, respectively, during August.

Why Real Estate Sector Benefits From Interest Rate Cuts

Lower household borrowing costs and improved refinancing opportunities, fueled by expectations of declining interest rates, can significantly boost the profitability of real estate companies.

Real estate stocks, as represented by the VNQ ETF, have climbed 35% since their October 2023 lows, with a striking 14% gain in just the last two months, far outpacing the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY)'s modest 3% rise over the same period.

This robust outperformance in real estate stocks aligns closely with growing market expectations for impending interest rate cuts.

As illustrated in the chart below, the largest real estate ETF has moved inversely to the 2-year Treasury yield, a crucial indicator of market expectations for short-term interest rates.

Artificial intelligence server company Super Micro Computer, Inc (NASDAQ:SMCI) stock is trading lower Thursday in sympathy with the broader semiconductor selloff led by its clients, including Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD).

Despite the selloff, analysts continue to hail Nvidia as the critical AI play, implying the continued potential for the AI frenzy. The selloff has rendered the valuation of the semiconductor companies as more attractive entry points.

Super Micro Computer stock has increased 136% in the last 12 months and is currently trading at a price-to-earnings multiple of 13.73x. Nvidia, up 176%, is currently trading at a 33.16 PE multiple.

Recently, Taiwanese rail kit supplier Nan Juen International Co, a Super Micro Computer partner, inked a deal with Nvidia to ramp up rail kit production for GB200 AI servers.

The market value of AI servers has the potential to surpass $187 billion in 2024, implying a growth rate of 69% driven by the demand for advanced AI servers from major CSPs and brand clients, as per TrendForce.

The market potential for AI servers backed by demand from Big Tech giants, including Nvidia, AMD, Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Amazon Web Services, and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) explains Super Micro Computer’s stock price trajectory.

Super Micro Computer reported a topline growth of 144% in the fourth quarter. Analysts expected the AI server company’s margin weakness to recover by fiscal 2025, easing the competitive pricing environment.

Investors can gain exposure to Super Micro Computer through Invesco QQQ Trust, Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ), and SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE:SPY).

Price Action: SMCI shares traded lower by 2.77% at $606.50 at the last check on Thursday.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares are trading higher by 5.77% to $213 during Thursday's session. The stock is trading higher after stronger-than-expected retail sales, potentially signaling increased consumer demand and confidence, which may boost expectations for higher vehicle sales.

The strong retail sales data indicates that consumers are willing and able to spend more, which bodes well for high-ticket items like electric vehicles (EVs). Tesla, as a leader in the EV market, could benefit from increased demand for its cars, driving higher sales and revenue.

Among the spending categories highlighted in the report, motor vehicle and parts dealers saw a 3.6% increase, which suggests growing consumer interest in purchasing vehicles. As consumers increasingly prioritize environmentally friendly options, Tesla stands to capture a large share of this increased demand for vehicles.

Additionally, a strong labor market, indicated by lower-than-expected jobless claims, supports economic stability, which can translate into greater consumer confidence in making significant purchases like cars. Tesla's premium products are more likely to see sustained or increased sales in such an environment.

The rise in major indexes Thursday, such as the Invesco QQQ Trust, Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ) and SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), also often lifts individual stocks within these indices. Tesla, being a significant component of these indices, could see its stock rise in tandem with broader market gains as investors move into riskier assets like tech stocks during times of economic optimism.

How To Buy TSLA Stock

By now you’re likely curious about how to participate in the market for Tesla – be it to purchase shares, or even attempt to bet against the company.

Buying shares is typically done through a brokerage account. You can find a list of possible trading platforms here. Many will allow you to buy ‘fractional shares,’ which allows you to own portions of stock without buying an entire share. For example, some stocks, like Berkshire Hathaway, or Amazon.com, can cost thousands of dollars to own just one share. However, if you only want to invest a fraction of that, brokerages will allow you to do so.

In the case of Tesla, which is trading at $201.38 as of publishing time, $100 would buy you 0.5 shares of stock.

If you’re looking to bet against a company, the process is more complex. You’ll need access to an options trading platform, or a broker who will allow you to ‘go short’ a share of stock by lending you the shares to sell. The process of shorting a stock can be found at this resource. Otherwise, if your broker allows you to trade options, you can either buy a put option, or sell a call option at a strike price above where shares are currently trading – either way it allows you to profit off of the share price decline.

According to data from Benzinga Pro, TSLA has a 52-week high of $278.98 and a 52-week low of $138.80.

Looking For Higher-Yield Opportunities?

CNBC Mad Money host Jim Cramer has said in the past that Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is good for one’s investment portfolio. On Monday, the stock picker said a Trump White House could also be good for income earners.

What Happened: “If you're in the stock market, if you care about your paycheck, you go with Trump,” Cramer said while appearing on Squawk Box. “That's what you do,” he said.

Don't Miss:

The average American couple has saved this much money for retirement — How do you compare? Can you guess how many Americans successfully retire with $1,000,000 saved? The percentage may shock you.

Offering the rationale for the view, Cramer told Squawk Box host David Faber that the former president would cut taxes on income. Faber countered him saying his taxes were raised enormously during the previous Trump administration, adding that he lived in a blue-walled state.

Incidentally, in a late-July episode of Mad Money show, which he hosts, Cramer said Vice President Kamala Harris, who is pitched against Trump, is an ideal candidate for investors looking to put their money in tech or international stocks. “If you're looking to invest in tech, you want a world where tech has a voice in Washington, not slashed vocal chords under Trump or on mute under Biden” and also ""If you own many stocks of international companies and you want to vote your portfolio, Harris is more likely to help than hurt,” he said.

Trending:Can you guess which type of investments Morgan Stanley says will reach $2.7 trillion by 2027? It even offers up to 20% APY potential to accredited investors up to $300 back in bonus for new users.

Why It’s Important: The Trump campaign’s economic policy envisages a reduction in federal corporate taxes from the current 21%. It was rumored that his team floated the idea of imposing tariffs in order to make up for lost revenues from lowered taxes.

The gravitation of the so-called billionaire boys or Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and businessmen toward Trump is partly inspired by expectations that he would pursue pro-business policies and advocate less stringent regulations.

Unlike what Cramer suggested, it isn’t very clear whether Trump will go on to downwardly adjust individual income taxes.

Economist and former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers said the former president’s tariff proposals are the biggest supply shock that will likely push up prices of not just imported goods but all goods that compete with those imported.

Summers sees increased inflation and inflation expectations, prompting the Fed to act to prove its credibility. “This could easily be a prescription for a 10% mortgage rate,” he added.

Global equity markets, commodities, and cryptocurrencies all crashed on Black Monday 2.0, and investors are worried about the unabated sell-off. Against this backdrop, social media tapped into sagacious comments from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos in the aftermath of the 2000 dotcom bubble burst to draw some encouragement.

Don't Miss:

Amid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500. Here’s the AI-powered startup that turns traders into influencers achieving 12% monthly growth – invest in it at only 10 cents per share. If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?

What Happened: When Amazon shares were annihilated along with the other tech stocks in 2000, Bezos strived to calm the agitated shareholders through his letter to them. Excerpts of the letter that Bloomberg journalist JonErlichman shared showed the billionaire reeling off Amazon’s achievements in fiscal year 2000. “Our shares are down more than 80% from when I wrote you last year. Nevertheless, by almost any measure, Amazon.com the company is in a stronger position now than at any time in its past,” he said.

See Also: Don’t miss out on the next Nvidia – you can invest in the future of AI for only $10.

To substantiate his claim, he noted that Amazon’s customer count increased from 14 million to 20 million between 1999 and 2000, sales climbed from over 68% to $2.76 billion, pro forma operating loss narrowed by 6% and average spend per customer rose 19%, among other things.

Bezos tapped into the wisdom of Benjamin Graham, who is widely called the father of value investing. The Amazon founder quoting Graham said the stock market is like a voting machine in the short term and a weighing machine in the long term,

“Clearly there was a lot of voting going on in the boom year of '99—and much less weighing,” Bezos said.

Trending:These five entrepreneurs are worth $223 billion – they all believe in one platform that offers a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends

“We're a company that wants to be weighed, and over time, we will be—over the long term, all companies are. In the meantime, we have our heads down working to build heavier and heavier company,” he added.

Why It’s Important: On Monday, Amazon shares fell a little over 4%, less than what most of its mega-cap tech peers lost. Bezos is not part of the active management team of Amazon now and serves as chairman of the board, and the e-commerce giant is led by his successor Andy Jassy.

True to what Bezos said, Amazon has now grown as a heavier company. The second-quarter results released last week showed the top line growing to $147.98 billion and earnings coming in at $1.26 per share. Apart from the core e-commerce business, the company has diversified its operations to include a thriving cloud computing business called AWS, giving it exposure to the hot-and-happening artificial intelligence technology.

From the post-dotcom bubble burst bottom of a split-adjusted 30 cents per share (split-adjusted price), the stock has risen to $161.02, a gain of about 54,000%.

The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), an exchange-traded fund that tracks the S&P 500 Index, ended Monday’s session down 2.91% at $517.38, according to Benzinga Pro data.

The retail order imbalance ended the day at -$1 billion, which is -2.5 standard deviations below the 12-month average. Inflows into ETFs of $472 million were outweighed by outflows from individual stocks at -$1.4 billion.

Institutional investors, on the other hand, bought the dip with +$14 billion in net buying (+2.9 standard deviations above the 12-month average) during market hours and -$6.7 billion in Market on Close (MOC) trades.

There was also strong demand for S&P ETFs, JPMorgan said, indicated by a $430 million inflow into Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:VOO), SPDR® S&P 500 (NYSE:SPY), and iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:IVV), which were +7.6, +1.2, and +2.6 standard deviations above their respective 12-month averages.

In contrast, retail investors were significant sellers of Nasdaq 100 ETFs. Fixed-income ETFs also saw bearish flows, led by TMF and SPDR® Bloomberg 1-3 Month T-Bill ETF (NYSE:BIL).

Strategists pointed out that the current downtrend has not altered Retail’s longer-term positioning.

“We estimate retail investor performance has declined by 10% since the peak in US equities as of today (vs. 8.5% drop in the S&P). Year-to-date, their portfolio is down by -4.9%,” they wrote.

U.S. stocks experienced significant losses on Monday, with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 each dropping over 3%. The drop continued last week's sell-off driven by recession fears and a sharp decline in Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) after a major investor reduced its stake.

All three major indexes recorded their largest three-day percentage declines since June 2022, with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 hitting their lowest points since early May.

The fears of a recession rattled global markets, prompting investors to exit risky assets following weak economic data, including Friday's disappointing U.S. payroll report.

Investors are concerned that the economy is slowing faster than expected and that the Federal Reserve may have made a mistake by keeping interest rates steady at its last policy meeting.

Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) and Marvel Studios’ “Deadpool & Wolverine” continue dominating the box office, grossing $824 million globally after two weekends in release.

The movie raked $38.5 million in Thursday previews, reaching a record for an R-rated film.

The comic book sequel, featuring Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman reprising their roles, has already surpassed the entire theatrical runs of 2016’s “Deadpool” ($783 million) and 2018’s “Deadpool 2” ($786 million), Variety reports.

“Deadpool & Wolverine” is now the second-highest grossing movie of 2024, trailing only “Inside Out 2” ($1.555 billion), and ranks as the third-biggest R-rated movie in history after “Joker” ($1.07 billion) and “Oppenheimer” ($975 million). It’s on track to cross the $1 billion mark soon.

This weekend, Disney became the first studio in 2024 to surpass $3 billion in worldwide ticket sales with only four nationwide releases: “Deadpool & Wolverine,” “Inside Out 2,” “Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes” ($397 million), and “The First Omen” ($53 million).

The film has also performed well in premium formats like Imax Corp (NYSE:IMAX), contributing $17.5 million in global weekend ticket sales and $64.5 million.

Disney purchased Marvel for $4 billion in 2009. According to the Hollywood Reporter’s March reports, Marvel has added approximately $13.2 billion in value to Disney.

In May, Disney reported revenue growth of 1% year-on-year to $22.08 billion, lagging the analyst consensus estimate of $22.11 billion.

Investors can gain exposure to Disney through SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE:SPY) and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:VOO).

Wall Street is experiencing a sharp decline on the last trading day of the week, with all indices in the red at noon in New York, as a cooler-than-expected July jobs report rattled risk sentiment and sparked concerns that the Federal Reserve may have erred in delaying a rate cut until September.

Nonfarm payrolls slowed to 114,000 in July, a decline of 65,000 from June and well below the expected 150,000. More alarmingly, the unemployment rate increased from 4.1% to 4.3%.

As a result, market-implied probabilities over a 50-basis-point cut in September have spiked to 73%, according to CME Group FedWatch tool.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 has entered a correction phase after surpassing a 10% drawdown since its July peak. Mega-cap, high-quality tech stocks offered no refuge to investors, as the Magnificent Seven giants all suffered losses except for Apple Inc., buoyed by an upbeat earnings report. Collectively, the Magnificent Seven lost over $300 billion in market value on Friday alone.

The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), popularly known as the market’s fear gauge, surged over 30% to reach the high-20 levels.

Small caps were again the weakest segment of the market, given their heightened sensitivity to economic fundamentals. The Russell 2000 tumbled over 3%, extending declines after a 3.4% loss on Thursday.

Consumer discretionary and technology were the worst-performing sectors, while semiconductors led the selloff among industries. The iShares Semiconductor ETF (NYSE:SMH) plummeted over 5%, marking a double-digit loss in the last two sessions, its worst performance since March 2020.

Nvidia Corp. fell an additional 3.4% following a 6.7% decline on Thursday, as the chipmaker came under investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice for potential antitrust violations.

Treasuries were the biggest gainers among major assets, reflecting a broad-based flight-to-quality sentiment. The iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT) rallied 2.9%, its strongest performance since the U.S. regional bank crisis in March 2023.

The Japanese yen also gained significantly, with the Invesco CurrencyShares Japanese Yen Trust (NYSE:FXY) up 1.8%.

Gold edged down slightly by 0.6%, while oil prices fell more than 4% for the day, with West Texas Intermediate (WTI) light crude retreating to $72 a barrel.

Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) fell over 3%.

Tech stocks soared to their best session in five months on Wednesday, ahead of the highly anticipated Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. This broad tech rally was propelled by a sharp rebound in chipmakers, buoyed by robust corporate earnings and easing concerns over chip export restrictions to China.

The Federal Reserve is expected to maintain interest rates at 5.25-5.50%, but market attention is fixed on Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET, for any hints of a potential rate cut in September, which market participants have fully priced in.

The Nasdaq 100 surged 2.7%, with 87 of its constituents in positive territory, led by Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), which jumped 11%. The tech-heavy index hasn’t experienced such a rally since February 2024.

The Biden administration is planning to introduce new regulations next month to restrict the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to Chinese chipmakers, with key allies like Japan, the Netherlands, and South Korea being exempt, according to Reuters.

The iShares Semiconductor ETF (NYSE:SOXX) soared over 5%, also marking its strongest session since late February 2024.

The S&P 500 also posted solid gains, rising 1.6%. Small caps, tracked by the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE:IWM), increased by 1.1%, eyeing their highest close since January 2022. Blue chips climbed 0.7%.

The dollar eased 0.2%, weighed down by a disappointing July private employment report released earlier by the ADP. The Japanese yen, tracked by the Invesco CurrencyShares Japanese Yen Trust (NYSE:FXE), rallied 1.4% following an overnight rate hike by the Bank of Japan.

In commodities, gold rose 0.7%, surpassing $2,400 per ounce, and silver climbed 1.4%. Oil prices surged 3% amid escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East following the assassination of Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh by Israeli forces in Iran.

Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) edged up 0.3%.

Investor sentiment took a hit on Tuesday as caution prevailed ahead of significant market events, including key tech earnings reports and the Federal Open Market Committee meeting.

The Nasdaq 100, heavily weighted with tech stocks, experienced the most significant decline among major U.S. indices, dropping 1.5%. Semiconductor stocks were particularly affected, with Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) plummeting over 6% to a two-month low, impacting the entire industry.

Consequently, the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NYSE:SOXX) fell nearly 3%, marking its sixth negative close in the last eight sessions.

The S&P 500 also dipped 0.8%, primarily due to its heavy tech exposure, while the Dow Jones and Russell 2000 managed to avoid losses. Notably, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE:IWM) has outperformed tech stocks by 15% so far this month.

Microsoft Corp. (NYSE:MSFT) declined more than 1% ahead of its post-market earnings announcement, while AppleInc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), AlphabetInc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and MetaPlatforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) experienced smaller losses in anticipation of their reports later in the week.

Crowdstrike Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) was the worst-performing tech stock on Tuesday, plunging nearly 12% after Delta Air Lines announced it would seek compensation from the cybersecurity firm for last week's outage.

Meanwhile, Treasury yields remained steady, gold edged up 0.3%, and the Japanese yen, tracked by the Invesco CurrencyShares Japanese Yen Trust (NYSE:FXY), gained 0.4% against the dollar in anticipation of a potential Bank of Japan rate hike.

Wall Street opened higher at the start of a data-heavy week, with traders adopting an optimistic tone ahead of crucial earnings reports and economic events.

The S&P 500 rose 0.4% by midday trading in New York, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 climbed 0.8%. The blue-chip index inched 0.1% up, and small caps slipped 0.8%.

Four out of the six largest U.S. corporations – including Microsoft Corp. (NYSE:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) – are set to report their latest quarterly earnings between Tuesday and Thursday.

Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve will hold its two-day Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, concluding Wednesday with the rate statement and Fed Chair Jerome Powell‘s press conference.

The Fed is widely expected to keep interest rates steady, but traders will closely watch for any signals of a potential rate cut in September. Market-implied odds currently fully factor in a September rate cut, as shown by CME Group’s FedWatch tool.

Additionally, crucial labor market statistics will be released this week, including the June Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTs) on Tuesday, July private payroll numbers from Automatic Data Processing Inc. on Wednesday, and the highly anticipated official employment report for July on Friday.

Treasury yields were mostly flat for shorter-dated maturities, while yields for both the 10-year and 30-year tenors fell by 2 basis points on Monday. The iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT) rose 0.4%.

In commodities markets, oil fell 1.1%, with West Texas Intermediate (WTI) light crude dropping below $76, hitting a fresh 7-week low as bearish demand developments in China outweighed supply concerns from rising Middle East tensions. U.S. natural gas prices also fell 1.4%.

Gold inched 0.5% lower, while copper and silver declined 0.7% and 1.4%, respectively. Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) held steady at around $68,000, failing to rally significantly despite bullish headlines over the weekend.

Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is making significant strides in artificial intelligence with its homegrown AI chips.

In its Austin, Texas, chip lab, Amazon engineers are rigorously testing a new server design that features these AI chips, aiming to reduce reliance on Nvidia Corp’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) costly chips, Reuters reports.

Amazon’s efforts align with similar initiatives by rivals Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google parent Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL).

Here’s the AI-powered startup that turns traders into influencers achieving 12% monthly growth – invest in it at only 10 cents per share. Don’t miss out on the next Nvidia – you can invest in the future of AI for only $10.

Rami Sinno, director of engineering for Amazon’s Annapurna Labs, highlighted the growing customer demand for more affordable alternatives to Nvidia. Annapurna Labs, acquired by Amazon in 2015, is integral to this development.

Trending:Don’t miss the real AI boom – here’s how to use just $10 to invest in high growth private tech companies.

Amazon has been developing its Graviton chips, which perform non-AI computing tasks, for nearly a decade. The latest AI chips, Trainium and Inferentia, offer significant cost savings.

“The offering of up to 40%, 50% in some cases of improved price and performance means it should be half as expensive as running that same model with Nvidia,” said David Brown, Vice President of Compute and Networking at AWS, according to Reuters.

Sales at AWS, which accounts for almost 20% of Amazon’s total revenue, grew by 17% to $25 billion in the January-March quarter compared to the previous year. AWS holds approximately one-third of the cloud computing market, with Microsoft’s Azure at about 25%.

Analysts view Nvidia as the primary beneficiary in the AI sector. Mizuho Securities reports that Nvidia controls 70% to 95% of the market share for artificial intelligence accelerators.

The Big Tech trio—Google, Microsoft, and Amazon—along with Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL)—contribute more than 40% of Nvidia’s revenue.

Amazon stock gained over 40% in the last 12 months, reaching a market cap of $1.87 trillion. Nvidia stock surged over 147% in the last 12 months and currently has a market cap of $2.76 trillion. Investors can gain exposure to the stocks through SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE:SPY) and iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:IVV).

Price Action: AMZN shares traded higher by 1.47% at $182.50 premarket at the last check on Friday Morning.

Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) tapped Dr. Naga Chandrasekaran of Micron Technology, Inc (NASDAQ:MU) as chief global operations officer, executive vice president and general manager of Intel Foundry Manufacturing and Supply Chain organization, effective August 12.

Chandrasekaran, an Oklahoma State University, University of California, Berkeley, and University of California, Los Angeles alumni, served as Micron’s senior vice president for Technology Development.

Chandrasekaran took over from Keyvan Esfarjani, who has decided to retire from Intel after nearly 30 years of service.

Chandrasekaran will lead Intel Foundry’s worldwide manufacturing operations, including Fab Sort Manufacturing, Assembly Test Manufacturing, strategic planning for Intel Foundry, corporate quality assurance, and supply chain.

The Intel Foundry business combines all the critical components that fabless customers need to design and manufacture chips for a new era of AI-driven computing.

The leadership change will be crucial for Intel as it sets ambitious targets, including $1 billion in software revenue before 2027, up from over $100 million in 2021, where its upcoming Gaudi 3 chip will play a key role.

Intel remains aggressively invested in its AI ambitions. It expects to ship chips for over 100 million AI PCs by 2025, including over 40 million in 2024.

In the second quarter of 2024, DNB Asset Management, with AUM of $88 billion, more than doubled its investment in Intel.

Intel stock lost 8% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock through Invesco QQQ Trust, Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ), and SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE:SPY).

Intel Stock Prediction For 2024

Intel’s revenue growth in FY23 was -14.0%, reflecting the influence of various factors including the macroeconomic environment, demand for its products and services, and its position relative to competitors. This growth is a critical indicator for investors assessing the company’s future prospects.

Some macro factors that could impact the company's performance in the next year include higher interest rates, progress on reeling in inflation and labor market strength. The Fed's benchmark rate is currently at 5.33%, while PPI recently came in at 0.2%, growing 2.6% from last year. The unemployment rate was most recently reported as 4.1%.

An investor should pay attention to economic conditions to decide whether they think the macro environment is positive or negative for Intel stock. For real time economic data and breaking market updates, check out Benzinga Pro. Try it for free.

How does this stack up against Intel's peers?

Investors may also want to analyze a stock in comparison to companies with similar products or in similar industries. Intel operates in the Information Technology sector. The stock has experienced average annual growth of -16.55% compared to the 12.31% average of its peer companies. This is below the broader sector movement of Intel.

Price Action: INTC shares are down 0.14% at $31.66 at the last check Thursday.

Wednesday was the worst day for the overall market in 2024, with the SPDR S&P 500 Index (NYSE:SPY) trading down more than 2% and the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NYSE:QQQ) trading down more than 3.5% late in the session.

Many mega-cap tech names that have driven much of the last year's rally sold off significantly on the day, with NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) each trading down more than 5%.

Don’t Miss:

Here’s how much you should have invested in Nvidia in 2022 to become a millionaire today. This platform is offering 8.1% APY on idle cash and up to 15 FREE Stocks with qualified deposits for a limited time.

But, even when the market gets hammered, there are ways to make money. Short-dated options contracts are a risky way to play the market, but when they go right, they can be a vehicle to make large gains very quickly.

On Tuesday, put contracts on the QQQs with a strike price of $469 that expired Wednesday afternoon closed at $.05 a contract, according to Robinhood Markets (NASDAQ:HOOD). At the time, the QQQs were trading at more than $480 a share, making it very unlikely that the index would trade below the strike price.

At their highs on Wednesday, those same contracts that would have cost $5 on Tuesday, were worth more than $510 a pop. This means that 100 contracts of those specific puts could have been purchased for $500 on Tuesday, and sold for more than $50,000 on Wednesday, good for a gain of more than 9,900%.

Trending:

Put contracts give the buyer the right to sell the underlying equity (in this case 100 shares of the QQQs) at the predetermined strike price, regardless of where the stock is trading, up until the expiration date. With Wednesday's wicked red day, well outside the standard deviation move of the overall market, those put contracts exploded in price.

Typically, the $SPY or $QQQs don't move more than 2% in a single day. But, because Tuesday afternoon featured earnings reports from two of the biggest holdings in each index (Tesla and Google) there was an extra catalyst, making the market prime for a larger-than-expected move.

Not to mention the fact that the rapid rise of volatility on Wednesday also increased the value of the contracts. When the VIX (an indicator of market volatility) goes higher, so does the underlying value of options contracts. This is because the increased volatility makes it more likely that a stock could hit the strike price associated with the options contract.

On Tuesday, Wall Street saw a mixed session, with small-cap stocks outperforming large caps as investors anticipated key earnings reports from Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), set to be released after the close.

The Russell 2000 index, as replicated by the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE:IWM), climbed 0.8%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 dipped 0.2%. This marked the ninth time in the last 10 sessions that small caps have outperformed tech stocks. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones showed little movement.

United Parcel Service Inc. (NYSE:UPS) stood out among the mega-cap stocks, plunging 14% after missing earnings and revenue estimates for the previous quarter. This decline is poised to be the worst one-day drop for the shipping company since it went public in 1999.

Both Treasury yields and the U.S. dollar remained stable ahead of a data-heavy week, featuring the Q2 GDP report on Thursday and the Fed’s favored inflation report on Friday.

Gold inched up 0.3%, reaching $2,400 per ounce, while Bitcoin dropped over 2% to $65,800, marking its second straight session of losses.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM) stock opened lower Monday premarket as U.S. President Joe Biden withdrew from the 2024 Presidential race.

On Sunday, Biden, 81, revealed his decision through a letter on social media platform X after a lackluster debate performance and increasing pressure from fellow Democrats to step aside.

The broader artificial intelligence chip sector led by Taiwan Semiconductor, Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) noted a selloff last week after former President Donald Trump suggested that Taiwan should compensate the U.S. for its defense, highlighting the lack of a formal defense treaty.

Additionally, last week, reports indicated the U.S. intensified its advanced semiconductor sanctions against China, a significant market for Nvidia and its U.S. peers.

SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), representing the US S&P500 index, lost 2.4% last week. iShares China Large-Cap ETF (NYSE:FXI), representing China, lost over 4%.

The AI chip stocks, including Nvidia and AMD, opened higher Monday premarket, reversing last week's losses.

Nvidia is reportedly developing a new AI chip tailored to meet US export restrictions for the Chinese market. Reports indicated Nvidia collaborating with Inspur, a key distribution partner in China, to introduce and distribute the new chip, tentatively named ""B20,"" which is part of Nvidia's ""Blackwell"" series.

It’s deep red on Wall Street on Wednesday, with tech stocks sharply falling amid a semiconductor broad-based selloff following news that the Biden administration is hastening export restrictions to China.

Bloomberg reported on Wednesday that the U.S. administration has advised its allies to impose the strictest trade restrictions possible if companies such as Tokyo Electron Ltd. (OTCPK: TOELY) and ASML Holding NV (NASDAQ:ASML) persist in supplying advanced chips to China. Shares of the Dutch chipmaker ASML Holding fell nearly 12%, notching the worst decline since March 2020.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 tumbled by 2.7% at 12:45 p.m. ET, marking the worst session since late August 2023. The semiconductor industry was the hardest hit. The iShares Semiconductor ETF (NYSE:SOXX) and the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NYSE:SMH) both plummeted over 6%, marking their worst day since October 2022.

The elite group of the ‘Magnificent Seven,’ tracked by the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (NASDAQ:MAGS), saw a collective market cap loss of $500 billion in a single trading session. Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) alone plummeted 7%, accounting for a $180 billion loss.

The S&P 500 dropped 1.2%, while blue-chip stocks of the Dow Jones rose 0.6% to 41,200 points, extending their all-time highs and marking a sixth consecutive session of gains. Meanwhile, small caps took a breather, with the Russell 2000 index falling 1%, ending a five-day winning streak.

U.S. natural gas futures fell over 6%, hitting two-month lows, due to lower-than-expected cooling demand amid milder weather forecasts for the next two weeks.

Oil prices rallied 1.9% after U.S. inventories declined again last week. Gold edged down 0.5% from the all-time highs reached on Tuesday. The dollar fell 0.4%, with the dollar-yen pair dropping 1.3%.

Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) eased 1.2%.

It’s another memorable day for the stock market, as the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average Index reaches new record highs, surpassing the 40,000-mark milestone and breaking the previous peak set in May.

Small caps continue their rally driven by strong bets on interest rate cuts, sustaining momentum after Thursday’s extraordinary surge. The Russell 2000 Index, as tracked by the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE:IWM), has had its best week of the year, gaining over 6%.

Each of the eleven S&P 500 sectors showed a gain Friday, with the index of the 500 largest U.S. corporations rising 0.9%. For the S&P 500, this marks the tenth positive week out of the last twelve.

The Nasdaq 100 also showed a solid rebound, rising by 1% after a 2.2% selloff the previous day.

On the macro front, producer inflation rose more than expected in June. However, this did not affect expectations for rate cuts, with traders firmly anticipating a cut in September, assigning it a near-certain probability.

The consumer sentiment index measured by the University of Michigan continues to show signs of weakness in July, though it also indicates a decrease in future inflation expectations.

Major banks such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), and Wells Fargo & Co. (NYSE:WFC) reported better-than-expected earnings, yet market reactions were negative, particularly for Wells Fargo amid a weakening outlook on net interest income.

Treasury yields were steady, with the 10-year yield hovering at 4.20%, on track for the lowest close since late March. The dollar weakened further, poised for its second consecutive week of declines.

In commodities markets, gold inched up 0.1%, battling for its fourth straight session of gains. Natural gas spiked 3%, while oil prices softened by 0.2%.

In the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) rose by 1.3%, trading above $58,000.

A lower-than-expected inflation report for June caused wild market reactions, leading to a surge in traders’ expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts and boosting assets that are particularly sensitive to high interest rates.

As the annual inflation rate slowed from 3.3% to 3%, below the predicted 3.1%, and the monthly reading indicated the first contraction (-0.1%) in four years, traders swiftly increased their odds of a September rate cut, now placing a 92% chance.

Surprisingly, large-cap indices such as the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index fell, dropping 0.9% and 2.1% respectively, with the latter eyeing its worst daily performance of 2024, previously seen on April 30. These reactions suggest that market participants had likely already priced in rate cut expectations into tech stock valuations and are now rotating from top-performing sectors to laggards.

The outperformance of the S&P 500 real estate sector over tech by more than 5 percentage points marked the largest one-day relative change in over four years, indicating a potential sectoral shift.

Other assets making significant moves included small caps, with the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE:IWM) up 3.3%, its strongest one-day return since mid-December 2023; gold, up 1.7%; and long-dated Treasury bonds, with the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT) rallying 1.5%.

Equity industries showing notable growth were those positively impacted by the prospects of lower interest rates. Homebuilders, tracked by the SPDR Homebuilders ETF (NYSE:XHB), were up 6.7% for the day, their strongest one-day performance since mid-December 2023. Regional banks, represented by the SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (NYSE:KRE), rose 3.4%. Gold miners, tracked by the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX), climbed 2.4%, on track for their highest close since April 2022.

Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) was flat at $57,800.

Editor’s note: The headline and third paragraph of this story has been updated to more accurately depict the nature of Nvidia’s sales of AI chips in China to comply with US export controls.

Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is on track to sell $12 billion of artificial intelligence chips in China this year despite the U.S. export controls, the Financial Times reports.

According to analyst forecasts, the company will deliver more than 1 million new H20 chips, designed to comply with U.S. restrictions on selling AI processors to Chinese customers.

That figure is nearly double what Huawei is expected to sell for its China-made rival product, Ascend 910B, the FT cites SemiAnalysis, chip consultancy estimates.

Each H20 chip costs between $12,000 and $13,000, suggesting Nvidia could generate over $12 billion in sales, surpassing the $10.3 billion revenue from its entire China business in the previous financial year.

Colette Kress, Nvidia’s finance chief, noted a significant decline in revenue from its data center segment in China following the imposition of new export controls in October.

Before U.S. export controls, China accounted for more than a quarter of Nvidia’s total revenues. Even if the H20 chip meets analysts’ expectations, China may account for about 10% of sales this year.

Analysts at Morgan Stanley and SemiAnalysis report that the H20 chip is now shipping in volume and is popular among Chinese customers despite its lower performance than Nvidia’s US-sold chips.

Most Chinese AI companies have built their AI models on Nvidia’s ecosystem, making a switch to Huawei’s infrastructure time-consuming and costly.

Despite the restrictions, Nvidia’s overall revenues from China, including Hong Kong, grew more than 50% year-on-year to $2.5 billion in the most recent quarter.

Recent reports indicated that Nvidia is under scrutiny because of reports of its advanced AI chips being smuggled into China.

Around 12,500 AI chips are estimated to be smuggled annually, while Nvidia sold over 2.6 million A100 and H100 chips globally last year.

Nvidia stock gained over 203% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to Nvidia through SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE:SPY) and iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:IVV).

Price Action: NVDA shares were trading lower by 0.76% at $127.40 premarket at the last check on Friday.

The S&P 500 index climbed to new all-time highs, rising 0.3% during Tuesday’s session, aiming for a potential sixth consecutive positive close and remaining resilient after Fed Chair Jerome Powell‘s testimony before the Senate Banking Committee.

Powell used both hawkish tones – stating that it is not yet appropriate to cut rates until greater confidence on the 2% target is achieved – and dovish tones, noting recent progress and warning that a weakening labor market could be a significant factor for a rate cut.

Markets are looking ahead with confidence to the upcoming June inflation report, due this Thursday, which could solidify the already high expectations for a rate cut in September.

Financials were the top-performing sector on Tuesday, after Reuters reported that the Federal Reserve is considering revising a key rule that could save the nation's largest banks billions in capital.

Investors also anticipate the upcoming banking sector earnings report with three major banks – JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), and Wells Fargo & Co. (NYSE:WFC) – set to announce results on Friday.

Commodities were broadly softer, likely impacted by the second consecutive surge of a broader U.S. dollar basket and rising Treasury yields. Natural gas rose again by over 1% following supply disruptions caused by Hurricane Beryl.

Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) rose 1.8% to $57,800.

Elsewhere, French stocks, as tracked by the iShares MSCI France Index Fund (NYSE:EWQ), tumbled 1.6%, reflecting negative investor sentiment after left-wing parties’ election gain.

S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indices surged to new all-time highs on Friday, driven primarily by a rally in Magnificent Seven stocks, which collectively reached a market capitalization exceeding $16 trillion.

The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (NYSE:MAGS) increased by 1.4% on Friday, boosting its weekly gain to 7.7%, marking the strongest weekly performance since the fund’s inception.

As mega-cap tech stocks attracted larger gains, blue-chip stocks held steady, while small caps fell.

In June, the U.S. labor market showed signs of cooling despite a higher-than-expected increase in non-farm payrolls, due to previous downward revisions, a rise in the unemployment rate, and slower wage growth.

Economists have increasingly urged the Federal Reserve to initiate interest rate cuts, with September seen as the most likely starting point.

Traders quickly adjusted their expectations for rate cuts, assigning a 76% probability to a September move and now fully pricing in two rate cuts by the end of the year.

Treasury yields declined across the board, with the 2-year yield dropping by 7 basis points to 4.62%, and the 10-year yield falling by 6 basis points to 4.28%.

Gold prices advanced by 1.1%, fueling a rally in gold mining stocks, which outperformed other equity sectors on Friday. The VanEck Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) has surged nearly 7% over the last two sessions, marking its strongest two-day performance since early March.

In other markets, UK small-cap stocks, tracked by the iShares MSCI United Kingdom Small-Cap ETF (NYSE:EWUS), rallied 1.4% following a landslide victory for the Labour Party in the legislative elections, ending 14 years of Conservative rule.

Cryptocurrency markets were volatile on Friday. Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) prices hit an intraday low of $53,550 before recovering to $56,430.

Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is on track to sell $12 billion of artificial intelligence chips in China this year despite the U.S. export controls, the Financial Times reports.

According to analyst forecasts, the company will deliver more than 1 million new H20 chips, designed to circumvent U.S. restrictions on selling AI processors to Chinese customers.

That figure is nearly double what Huawei is expected to sell for its China-made rival product, Ascend 910B, the FT cites SemiAnalysis, chip consultancy estimates.

Each H20 chip costs between $12,000 and $13,000, suggesting Nvidia could generate over $12 billion in sales, surpassing the $10.3 billion revenue from its entire China business in the previous financial year.

Colette Kress, Nvidia’s finance chief, noted a significant decline in revenue from its data center segment in China following the imposition of new export controls in October.

Before U.S. export controls, China accounted for more than a quarter of Nvidia’s total revenues. Even if the H20 chip meets analysts’ expectations, China may account for about 10% of sales this year.

Analysts at Morgan Stanley and SemiAnalysis report that the H20 chip is now shipping in volume and is popular among Chinese customers despite its lower performance than Nvidia’s US-sold chips.

Most Chinese AI companies have built their AI models on Nvidia’s ecosystem, making a switch to Huawei’s infrastructure time-consuming and costly.

Despite the restrictions, Nvidia’s overall revenues from China, including Hong Kong, grew more than 50% year-on-year to $2.5 billion in the most recent quarter.

Recent reports indicated that Nvidia is under scrutiny because of reports of its advanced AI chips being smuggled into China.

Around 12,500 AI chips are estimated to be smuggled annually, while Nvidia sold over 2.6 million A100 and H100 chips globally last year.

Nvidia stock gained over 203% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to Nvidia through SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE:SPY) and iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:IVV).

Price Action: NVDA shares were trading lower by 0.76% at $127.40 premarket at the last check on Friday.

Wall Street experienced a lackluster session during midday trading in New York, with major indices inching slightly lower despite the arrival of positive inflation data.

In May 2024, the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) price index, the Federal Reserve’s key measure of inflation, fell to its lowest level since March 2021, recording an annual rate of 2.6%, which aligned with economists’ predictions.

This inflation report further indicates that price pressures are moving towards the Fed’s 2% target, reinforcing market expectations for potential interest rate cuts.

However, there is more caution in the market reactions this time, potentially because investors are evaluating the political and economic implications stemming from the first presidential debate held Thursday night between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, with most political analysts indicating a landmark win for the latter.

Energy stocks were the top performers among S&P 500 sectors on Friday, despite no concurrent gains in oil and gas prices, likely welcoming rising chances of Trump’s return to the White House.

Treasury yields rose across the curve, with the bond market beginning to price in a new increase in expansionary fiscal policies from the potential next president. The iShares Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT) fell by 1.3%.

Semiconductors are set to experience their second consecutive week of losses, while regional banks shine, with the SPDRS&P Regional Banking ETF (NYSE:KRE) potentially marking its best weekly performance since the beginning of the year.

Major commodities are little changed, with gold flat and oil down by 0.5%. Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) remains stuck around the 60,500 mark, down by 1.5%.

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) shares were trading lower on Thursday in the premarket session in sympathy with Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) after the company reported third-quarter financial results Wednesday.

The stock has recovered from the losses in the regular trading session on Thursday.

Meanwhile, AMD is set to introduce a new technology that promises to enhance the gaming experience by significantly reducing download times.

The Neural Texture Block Compression system, harnessing the power of artificial intelligence, will be showcased at the upcoming Eurographics Symposium on Rendering in London this July.

This development comes at a busy time for AMD, with the expected release of the first Zen 5 CPUs in July 2024.

AMD emphasizes AI, rebranding its laptop gaming CPUs under the AMD AI moniker, similar to its competitor Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA). Despite this focus, AMD acknowledges the strides needed to match Nvidia’s prowess in AI.

A statement from the AMD GPUOpen platform highlighted the universal disdain for lengthy game downloads, asserting that their novel AI-driven compression technique will substantially reduce data sizes. Nvidia previously explored a similar concept.

AMD stock gained 43% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock via Invesco QQQ Trust, Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ), and SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE:SPY).

Price Actions: AMD shares were trading higher by 0.48% at $158.30 at the last check on Thursday.

Wall Street experienced a mixed session on Wednesday, as investors adopted a cautious stance following Tuesday’s gains while awaiting key economic data releases later this week, including the Fed’s preferred inflation report due on Friday.

At noon in New York, major U.S. averages traded flat, showing a lack of direction. Notably, 10 out of 11 sectors in the S&P 500 were in the red, with consumer discretionary being the only sector to post gains. Small caps fell by 0.3%, while blue chips edged up by 0.1%.

The semiconductor industry failed to continue its rebound, as the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NYSE:SOXX) dropped 1%, with Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) down 2%.

Treasury yields rose, particularly at the long end of the curve, with both 10-year and 30-year yields increasing by 5-6 basis points, as traders slightly trimmed bets on a September rate cut.

The dollar gained further traction against a basket of major currencies, with the U.S. dollar index (DXY) eyeing its highest close since April 30.

Notably, the dollar-yen pair rose past 160, marking the weakest level for the Japanese currency since December 1987, as traders continued to test Bank of Japan’s policies.

Commodities were softer overall, with gold retracing 0.9% amid higher yields and a stronger greenback, natural gas dropping 2.7%, while oil prices edged up by only 0.2%.

Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) was 1% lower at $61,150, failing to sustain Tuesday’s 2.5% rise.

As the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indices continue to notch new all-time highs, it’s clear that the rising tide has not lifted all boats.

Sharp-eyed analysts and investors have noted some discordant features in a stock market at its peak, raising questions about the euphoria that currently reigns supreme on Wall Street.

Mega-Cap Dominance Unprecedented Since Late 2008

The dominance of mega-cap stocks hasn’t been this pronounced in nearly sixteen years.

The top 100 U.S. stocks by market capitalization, monitored through the iShares S&P 100 ETF (NYSE:OEF), have never been stronger against the Russell 1000 Index, as tracked by the iShares Russell 1000 ETF (NYSE:IWB), since December 2008-.

David Morrison, senior market Analyst at Trade Nation, commented, “There are concerns about the US market's lack of breadth with so much of the overall performance concentrated in the stock price of a few corporations. In fact, the five biggest companies by market capitalization in the S&P 500 account for nearly 30% of its value. The size and outperformance of this select group is reflected in its valuation, which is way above that of the rest of the constituents.”

Poor Participation In Market Rally

The current bull market rally lacks broad participation, with only a few companies driving the major indices higher.

The cap-weighted S&P 500 Index, tracked by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), has surged to levels last seen in November 2008 when compared to its equally-weighted counterpart, represented by the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (NYSE:RSP).

“We haven't had a four-week span where the US stock market has gone up so much with so many stocks within the market going down, based on data going back to 2002,” said Luke Kawa, markets editor at Sherwood.

SentimenTrader in a post on social media X, indicates that while the Nasdaq 100 continues to achieve record highs, many of its constituent stocks are underperforming, dropping to monthly, quarterly, or even yearly lows and falling below their 10-, 50-, and 200-day moving averages.

“This is not normal. In fact, it’s never happened before to this degree. There is a possibility that the average stock will catch up to the index, that is not how things usually pan out. Almost never, in fact. Risk is high in that index,” they wrote.

The Nasdaq 100 continues to notch record high after record high. Many of its stocks are not only lagging, but they're falling to monthly, quarterly, or even yearly lows and below their 10-, 50-, and 200-day moving averages.

Tech Supremacy Surpassing Historical Extremes

The tech sector has been the primary driver of the extreme relative valuations among major U.S. stock indices.

Story continues

The Nasdaq 100, when compared to both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Russell 2000, is at historic highs, surpassing previous peaks seen during the dot-com bubble and in December 2021 at the end of the ultra-low interest rate era.

After the Juneteenth holiday break, Wall Street reopened with a cautious tone, as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indices declined after hitting all-time highs around midday trading in New York. This decline was driven by profit-taking in chipmaker stocks and rising Treasury yields, which dampened risk sentiment.

The iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) fell by 2.4%, marking its worst session since May 1, after reaching technically “overbought” levels earlier in the week.

Oil prices surged above $81 a barrel, aiming for the highest close since late April. This was spurred by larger-than-expected drops in U.S. inventories last week, fueling a rally in oil-related companies.

Small caps also softened, whereas blue chips saw a rebound, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average outperforming other major indices with a 0.4% gain.

Long-dated Treasury yields rose, with the 10-year yield up by 5 basis points to 4.27%, following mixed economic data released earlier in the day. Jobless claims slightly increased more than expected last week, and a manufacturing activity gauge in the Philadelphia region fell short of estimates, reaching its lowest level in five months.

Additionally, housing data showed sharp declines in both housing starts and building permits, reigniting concerns about a tight real estate market.

Bonds fell, with the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT) down 0.9%. The U.S. dollar index (DXY) rose 0.4%, with the greenback gaining ground against all major currencies.

The Bank of England kept its key policy rate unchanged at 5.25%, as expected, while the Swiss National Bank cut rates by 0.25 percentage points to 1.25%. Consequently, the British pound and the Swiss franc fell by 0.5% and 0.8%, respectively, against the dollar.

Gold, tracked by the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD), rose by 1.1%, while Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) remained flat below $65,000.

Thursday’s Economic Releases: Key Highlights

The number of people filing for jobless claims in the U.S. fell by 5,000 to 238,000 in the week ending June 15, slightly exceeding market expectations of 235,000 as tracked by Econoday. The four-week moving average for initial claims, which smooths out week-to-week volatility, increased from 227,250 to 232,750, marking the highest level since September 2023. In May 2024, housing starts saw a significant decline, dropping 5.5% month-over-month to an annualized rate of 1.27 million. This was a decrease from a revised 1.352 million in April and fell short of the 1.37 million forecast. Single-family housing starts decreased by 5.2% to 982,000, while starts for buildings with five or more units were at 278,000. Building permits also dropped by 3.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.386 million in May 2024, down from 1.44 million in April, the lowest level since June 2020 and below the expected 1.45 million. The Philadelphia Federal Reserve's general activity index fell by 3 points to 1.3 in June, the lowest since January 2024 and below the forecast of 5.2. The current shipments index decreased by 6 points to -7.2, its lowest since December. The new orders index, while still negative, improved from -7.9 in May to -2.2 in June. The employment index rose but remained negative for the eight straight month, indicating a continued overall decline in employment levels. Regarding prices, both price indexes suggested ongoing overall price increases. The prices paid index rose 4 points to 22.5, while the current prices received index soared 7 points to 13.7. Most future activity indicators stayed positive but pointed to less widespread expectations for growth over the next six months.

Market Reactions

Treasury yields witnessed a slight uptick following the releases, with the 10-year yield rising from 4.23% to 4.26%.

The rate-sensitive 2-year yield, meanwhile, held steady at 4.73%.

The greenback held session gains, with the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), as tracked by the Invesco DB USD Index Bullish Fund ETF (NYSE:UUP), up 0.3% for the day.

Futures on major U.S. equity indices traded higher during the premarket trading on Thursday. Contracts on the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 were 0.3% and 0.4% higher, respectively, yet they marginally trimmed gains following the data.

38,2024-06-20T10:29:24+00:00,"JPM: Record low short interest in SPY, QQQ may expose US equities to vulnerability","The declining short interest in SPDR® S&P 500 (NYSE:SPY) and Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to successive record lows has been supporting US equities and reducing volatility over the past year, thus serving as an implicit short volatility (vol) trade, JPMorgan strategists said in a Thursday note.

SPY and QQQ, major vehicles for placing index-level positions on US equities, have seen their declining short interest bolster US equity indices as investors gradually covered their short positions.

“In turn this steady flow support from the gradual covering of short positions has suppressed realized vol, creating additional space to take bigger equity positions in notional terms,” strategists noted.

“In other words, the declining short interest over the past year in these two major ETFs has become the equivalent of an implicit short vol trade,” they added.

However, with short interest at historically low levels, this extended implicit short vol trade poses a vulnerability to US equities if negative news reverses the decline in short interest, they added.

The declining short interest at the index level poses a question of whether this trend corresponds to rising short interest in individual stocks. However, data does not support this hypothesis, JPMorgan highlights.

The firm’s analysis indicates no significant increase in short interest over the past year for individual stocks, whether examining the largest tech companies or the broader S&P 500 universe.

“The declining short in SPY and QQQ ETFs does not only reflect a net increase in US equity exposure by hedge funds over the past year, but also a shrinkage of short sellers,” strategists continued.

They believe this shrinkage is driven by difficulties in maintaining short positions in a rising market, regulatory transparency increasing shorting costs, and active retail investor engagement deterring short sellers.

As summer heats up, so does the stock market. The S&P 500, as tracked by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), has an intriguing historical seasonality pattern during presidential election years.

Looking back to 1928, an analysis conducted by Bank of America shows that the S&P 500 often kicks off summer with a solid performance in early June, which sets a bullish tone that tends to carry through the summer months.

“A late June lull could set up an early July rally,” says Stephen Suttmeier, CFA, CMT, an analyst at Bank of America.

Historical data underscores this trend: the last 10 sessions of June have shown uninspiring results, with the S&P 500 up only 48% of the time and an average return of just 0.02% (-0.19% median).

This means that during the final days of June, the market’s performance has historically been lackluster, with nearly half the days seeing slight losses. But this pause can be the calm before the storm, setting the stage for the strongest 10-day period of the year in early July.

But this pause can be a prelude to a significant upswing, setting the stage for the strongest 10-day period of the year in early July.

During this period, the S&P 500 has seen average returns of 1.54% and median returns of 1.91%. In simpler terms, early July has historically been a very good time for the stock market.

July and August: The Summer Rally Peaks

When it comes to presidential election years, the market’s behavior is even more pronounced as July and August typically yield positive returns.

The first 10 days of August are particularly strong, with the S&P 500 averaging a 1.53% gain. This is only slightly less than the 1.59% gain recorded in the first 10 days of June — historically the best window in election years.

“The SPX has continued to new all-time highs into mid-June, with the next major technical milestone being the 2022-2023 bullish cup and handle count in the 5600s, achievable during a summer rally,” Suttmeier wrote.

A “bullish cup and handle” is a technical chart pattern that suggests a potential for further gains.

It looks like a teacup on a chart, with a rounded bottom (the cup) and a slight downward drift (the handle). If this pattern holds, the S&P 500 could reach new highs in the 5600 range, indicating a strong summer rally.

Mega Caps Lead

Another key trend highlighted by Bank of America is the overperformance of mega caps relative to large caps.

Story continues

The S&P 100, which includes the U.S. 100 largest companies and tracked by the iShares S&P 100 ETF (NYSE:OEF), rallied 20% year to date, topping the S&P 500’s performance by 4 percentage points and matching that of the Nasdaq 100.

According to Suttmeier this is a bullish pattern, suggesting a potential late “1990s-style leadership melt-up” for mega caps compared to large caps. A “melt-up” refers to a strong market rally driven by a sudden surge in buying, rather than improving fundamentals.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated during his June press conference that policymakers “want to gain further confidence” on inflation before considering interest rate cuts, slightly dampening market enthusiasm fueled by a lower-than-expected inflation report released earlier Wednesday.

“So far this year, the data has not given us that greater confidence. The inflation data received earlier this year were higher than expected, though more recent monthly readings have eased somewhat,” Powell stated.

Powell welcomed today’s reading but warned that upcoming inflation data may be “good but not [as] great” as the last one, given unfavorable base effects from the second half of 2023 which is likely to affect annual readings.

Powell somehow cooled investor excitement over today’s reading: “That’s a step in the right direction. But one reading is only one reading.”

May Inflation Report Hasn’t Altered Fed’s New Inflation Outlook

Powell explained that Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members had the opportunity to update their inflation forecasts in the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) following the new inflation data for May that was released this morning. However, the outcome of the SEP likely indicates that the majority of members generally left their opinions unchanged.

The projected median total Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) inflation for this year has risen to 2.6%, an increase from 2.4% in March. Next year’s projection has also risen, now estimated at 2.3%, up from 2.2% in March. The projection for 2026 remains unchanged at 2.0%.

According to Powell, conditions in the labor market have returned into better balance, about where they stood on the eve of the pandemic, “relatively tight but not overheated.”

When asked whether a September rate cut is feasible given the prospect of just one rate cut in 2024 (as indicated in the SEP), Powell stressed that any decision will be data-dependent, as the Fed does not make decisions about future meetings until they have all the necessary information.

Powell reiterated: “We don’t see ourselves having the confidence that would warrant loosening policy,” stressing the need to witness further positive inflation data in the coming months.

The Fed Chair also hinted that an “unexpected weakening in the labor market” would also encourage the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates.

“We don’t want to wait things to break and then fix them,” Powell said, indicating that the Fed will be highly attentive in monitoring the evolution of labor market data.

Market Reactions

Stocks slightly trimmed their session gains, while Treasury yields recovered from the sharp declines experienced earlier in the day, triggered by the May inflation report.

Market-implied expectations for a September rate cut slightly eased from about 70% to 63%. Traders continue to expect two fully priced rate cuts by December 2024.

The S&P 500 Index, as tracked by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) was 0.8% higher at 3:30 p.m. ET, easing after hitting all-time highs earlier in the day.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100, tracked by the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) was 1.1% higher, cutting gains after it was 1.9% higher at 3:15 p.m. ET.

The yield on a 2-year Treasury bond traded at 4.76%, rebounding after hitting an intraday level as low as 4.67%.

A lower-than-expected inflation report for May ignited a bullish frenzy on Wall Street, with investors increasing their bets on rate cuts, bolstered by growing confidence that the Federal Reserve will ease its policy stance later this year as price pressures trend towards the 2% target.

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) data revealed cooler-than-anticipated monthly and annual inflation rates for both headline and core items.

This report arrives just ahead of the highly anticipated Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, which will commence at 2:00 p.m. ET today.

The implied probability of a rate cut by September has surged to 72%, up from 54% before the inflation report. Fed futures now indicate a 55 basis points reduction (equivalent to two rate cuts) by year-end.

In response to rising expectations for rate cuts, traders quickly pivoted to riskier assets.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 climbed 1.4% to over 19,400 points, setting new record highs. The S&P 500 Index increased by 1.1% to surpass 5,400 points, also achieving fresh all-time highs.

Blue-chip stocks saw a modest rise of 0.2%, but the standout performance came from small caps. The iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE:IWM) surged 2.7%, marking its best session since mid-December 2023.

Treasury yields plummeted across the board, with the 2-year yield dropping 15 basis points to 4.68%. Long-dated yields also declined by approximately 10 basis points, propelling the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT) up by 1.6%, its strongest one-day performance since early February 2024.

Industries sensitive to interest rates saw significant gains. The SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (NYSE:XHB) and the SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (NYSE:KRE) soared 4.6% and 3.5%, respectively.

Precious metals also rallied on the back of lower yields and a weakening dollar, with gold rising 0.8% and silver surging 2.8%.

Cryptocurrencies experienced sharp rallies driven by the risk-on sentiment. Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) jumped 3.6% to $69,800, while the more speculative Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) surged over 8% on the day.

44,2024-06-06T14:14:32+00:00,What's Going On With Nvidia Stock On Thursday?,"What's Going On With Nvidia Stock On Thursday?

Nvidia Corp’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock surged to record highs on Wednesday, valuing the company at over $3 trillion and making it the world’s second most valuable company, surpassing Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).

Nvidia plans a ten-for-one stock split on June 7 to attract more individual investors.

Nvidia’s valuation has soared 147% in 2024 due to strong demand for AI processors from companies like Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL).

On Wednesday, Nvidia added nearly $150 billion in market capitalization, more than the entire value of AT&T Inc (NYSE:T), Reuters reports.

Jake Dollarhide, CEO of Longbow Asset Management, remarked, “Nvidia is making money on AI right now, and companies like Apple and Meta are spending on AI.”

Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang received widespread media coverage at Computex in Taipei. Meanwhile, Apple faces weak iPhone demand and stiff competition in China.

According to S&P Dow Jones Indices, five companies, including Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), account for about 60% of the S&P 500’s total return of over 12% this year. Nvidia alone has contributed roughly a third of this gain, following a 147% surge in 2024.

Angelo Kourkafas, senior investment strategist at Edward Jones, highlighted potential market vulnerability if these key stocks falter and the rest of the market does not provide support.

Tajinder Dhillon, senior research analyst at LSEG, expects the earnings gap between the “Magnificent Seven” companies and the rest of the S&P 500 to narrow as 2024 progresses.

Recent reports indicated that Nvidia is preparing to ramp up investments in Taiwan, with plans to build its second supercomputer there. This underscores the importance of crucial supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM).

Nvidia has already tapped Samsung Electronics Co for the supply of high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips and is now eying Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) as a potential supplier to overcome the supply chain constraints.

Analysts reaffirmed Nvidia as the lead AI beneficiary after the recent Taiwan event, citing opportunities with its Hopper platform and Blackwell B100/200.

Nvidia stock gained over 217% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock via SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE:SPY) and iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:IVV).

Price Action: NVDA shares traded lower by 0.83% at $1,214.17 at the last check on Thursday.

The U.S. stock market’s Wednesday session is a historic one, as both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 indices closed at record high levels, driven by increased investor confidence in artificial intelligence-driven growth expanding from the tech sector to the broader market.

The S&P 500 Index, as tracked by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), closed the session 5,354 points, surpassing the latest all-time high close hit of 5,321 points hit on May 21.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index, as monitored through the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ), closed at a record high of 19,035 points, up 2% for day, notching its best daily performance in a month.

The group of the so-called Magnificent Seven – Microsoft Corp. (NYSE:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) – achieved a combined market valuation of $15 trillion, nearly half of the size of the remaining S&P 500 companies.

Notably, Nvidia surpassed a $3-trillion valuation, overtaking Apple to become the second most valuable U.S. company.

as of June 5, 2024

Encouraging sentiment in the services sector, as gauged by the ISM Services PMI data Wednesday, indicates the American economy continues to grow at a strong pace, alleviating some fears of a slowdown that had emerged in recent sessions.

In the labor market, Wednesday’s ADP report revealed lower-than-expected employment growth but also showed stalling wage growth, which helps keep inflation fears in check ahead of the highly awaited Friday jobs report.

Small caps also joined Wednesday’s rally, with the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE:IWM) up 1.5%.

Chipmakers were the best-performing industry, with the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NYSE:SMH) up 4.9%, achieving the second-strongest daily performance year-to-date.

Finding a safe, but profitable place for your idle cash can be challenging. ""The market is going to remain choppy,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial, ""There are questions as to: Where are we headed? Where's the economy headed?""

Amid surging economic headwinds and mounting international tensions, investing in passive ETFs that replicate the performance of indexes can be as safe of an investment as there is. In an era where market unpredictability is the norm, passive ETFs offer a stable, low-cost way to grow wealth.

Unlike actively managed funds, which rely on the expertise of a fund manager to select stocks, passive ETFs simply aim to replicate the holdings of their benchmark index. This results in relatively lower fees as well as surmounting diversification benefits.

SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust

The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) is one of the most well-known and widely held ETFs in the market. The ETF replicates the performance of the benchmark S&P 500 Index, which tracks the performance of the 500 largest companies in the U.S.

Interestingly, SPY was the first exchange-traded fund (ETF) listed in the United States back in 1993, revolutionizing the investment landscape. As of May 30, 2024, the fund's top holdings include some of the most influential and robust companies in the market. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is its largest holding,  accounting for 7% of the ETF's portfolio. Other large holdings include Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL, accounting for 6.31% of the fund's total portfolio, and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA), with a 6.20% weightage.

The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust boasts impressive returns as well. The ETF's year-to-date return stands at 10.3%, slightly higher than the benchmark index's 9.4% returns. Over the past year, SPY has returned 24%, beating the underlying index's 21.8% returns.

Shelton NASDAQ-100 Index Investor

The Shelton NASDAQ-100 Index Investor (NASDAQ:NASDX), named in the Forbes Advisor's 10 best mutual funds for 2024, is a promising passive ETF investment option. With $1.66 billion in total assets under management, the ETF aims to replicate the performance of the Nasdaq-100 Index, thereby benefiting from the market movements of tech giants and other key players that are at the forefront of innovation and the U.S. economy.

The fund invests in tech giants and other influential non-financial companies on the Nasdaq exchange, providing investors with a stake in major market players. Interestingly, the Shelton NASDAQ-100 Index adheres to a policy of investing at least 80% of its total assets in stocks that are constituents of the Nasdaq-100 Index.

Story continues

The ETF's year-to-date return stands at 10.24%, while its one-year return is over 21%. The strong tech sector performance has propelled the Shelton NASDAQ-100 Index's returns over this period, outperforming the overall stock market returns tracked by the S&P 500 index.

Vanguard Russell 2000 ETF

The Vanguard Russell 2000 ETF (NASDAQ:VTWO) targets the Russell 2000 Index, which consists of 2,000 small-cap companies. This ETF is ideal for investors looking to capitalize on the growth potential of smaller, potentially more agile companies.

The Vanguard Russell 2000 ETF has approximately $9.35 billion in total assets under management. The fund's largest holdings include Super Micro Computer Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI), MicroStrategy Inc. (NASDAQ:MSTR), and Comfort Systems USA, Inc. (NYSE:FIX).

The Russell 2000 Index is widely regarded as a barometer for small-cap stocks, known for their potential for high growth. Over the past year, the Vanguard Russell 2000 ETF has gained 13.5%, while the benchmark Russell 2000's returns stand at 13.3%.

Growth concerns dragged stocks lower on Tuesday, with all major indices trading in the red as investors took a cautious tone on riskier assets.

The S&P 500 faced selling pressure when attempting to break above 5,300 levels. It traded down 0.4% by midday in New York.

Major large-cap indices showed only marginal dips and small caps felt the brunt of the selloff while the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE:IWM) was down 1.4%.

On The Macro Front

Tuesday witnessed further indication of a potential slowing economic momentum, as already surfaced last week and on Monday.

The number of job openings in April fell sharply by 296,000, reaching the lowest level since February 2021 and missing expectations.

In response, traders increased their bets on a Federal Reserve rate cut in September. The CME Group Fed Watch tool now shows a 65% chance of a cut, up significantly from 46% last week.

The prospect of lower interest rates boosted bond prices, with the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT) rising 1%, on track for its fourth consecutive gain.

This rally benefited interest-rate sensitive stocks like real estate, which outperformed in the S&P 500.

Commodities took a tumble, with cyclical plays like copper, silver, and crude oil down 3%, 4% and 1.5%, respectively.

Oil prices are now down for five straight days, with the WTI trading at about $72 a barrel and heading to the lowest close in four months.

Bucking the overall bearish sentiment, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) surged 3%, breaking above $70,000.

All major U.S. equity indices opened the week with losses, as traders shifted to safe-haven bonds and gold amid concerns affecting the health of the U.S. manufacturing activity. In May, the ISM Manufacturing PMI dropped to 48.7, marking a faster-than-expected contraction.

This follows a bleak Chicago PMI report on Friday, which indicated the worst sentiment since May 2020.

The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), known as the market fear gauge, surged by 9% on a day marred by temporary technical glitches affecting several NYSE-listed stocks, including Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK) (NYSE:BRK) and Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. (NYSE:CMG).

At 12:40 p.m. in New York, the Nasdaq 100 index was down 0.5%, eyeing its fourth consecutive session of declines, potentially marking its longest losing streak since early January 2024.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average underperformed tech-heavy indices due to sharp losses in the energy and industrials sectors, weighing down the blue-chip index.

Treasury yields fell nearly 10 basis points, marking the highest one-day decline in yields since May 15 and the third-largest drop of the year. Bond-related assets surged, with the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond (NASDAQ:TLT) gaining 1.2%, aiming for its third consecutive day of gains.

As yields dropped, gold rose by 0.9%, fully recovering Friday’s losses, while Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) was up by 2.3%.

Bears knocked on Wall Street’s door again Friday, sending large-cap tech stocks lower despite the Fed’s favorite inflation measure meeting expectations.

Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 index are set to end a 5-week winning streak as investors grow more cautious about the latest economic developments.

In April 2024, the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) price index held steady at 2.7% year-on-year, matching the previous month and forecasts. The annual core inflation rate also remained unchanged at 2.8%, in line with expectations.

However, concerns arose from a deceleration in personal spending and income, raising fears that strong consumer momentum is waning. Additionally, the Chicago PMI dropped to its lowest level since May 2020, increasing worries about an ongoing economic slowdown.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 fell 1.5%, marking its third straight session of losses and its worst performance in a month. The S&P 500 was down 0.4%, the Russell 2000 edged 0.1% lower, while blue-chip stocks in the Dow Jones rose 0.3%, reflecting a shift to high-quality defensive stocks.

Treasury yields fell, boosting fixed-income assets, with the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT) rising 0.6%.

Wall Street experienced another decline on Thursday, with major large-cap indices affected by a downturn in the tech and communication services sectors.

Investors shifted their focus to market areas that have underperformed compared to tech over the past year, such as small caps, real estate and solar stocks.

In economic news, the second estimate of first-quarter GDP growth was revised down to 1.3% from the initial 1.6% estimate, driven by slower consumer spending growth. Inflation also saw a slight decrease.

New York Fed President John Williams stated there is no immediate need to adjust monetary policy and expects inflation to continue its decline, reaching the 2% target by 2025.

The S&P 500, Nasdaq 100, and Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 0.2%, 0.6% and 0.7%, respectively. In contrast, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE:IWM) increased by 1.2%.

Treasury yields decreased by approximately 5-6 basis points across the curve after several days of sharp increases. The iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT) rebounded by 0.9%.

In the commodities market, oil dropped 1.6% despite a significant decline in U.S. crude inventories, which fell by 4.16 million barrels in the week ending May 24, surpassing the predicted 1.95 million barrel decline, according to the EIA Petroleum Status Report.

Gold, tracked by the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD), rose 0.4%, and Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) surged 1.5%.

Volatility surged back into the market on Wednesday, with the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) spiking 9% after hitting nearly three-year lows last week, fueled by fresh upticks in Treasury bond yields.

The yield on the 30-year Treasury note, a crucial benchmark for mortgage rates nationwide, soared to 4.74%, rising more than 15 basis points over two sessions and nearing its highest close since May 2.

As yields climbed, bond prices dropped, with the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT) falling 1.3%, following a 1.4% decline on Tuesday.

Investors fear that the Fed will not cut interest rates more than once by the end of the year and not before November, as suggested by current Fed futures pricing.

All major U.S. equity indices and all eleven sectors traded in the red, on a day when the U.S. dollar effectively played its safe haven role. The Invesco DB USD Index Bullish Fund ETF (NYSE:UUP) rose 0.5%, marking its strongest day in a month.

Rising yields and a stronger dollar pressured commodities, with gold prices down 1%, oil down 1.3%, and natural gas down 5%.

Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) dropped 1.5%, echoing Tuesday’s decline.

Seasoned Wall Street investor Ed Yardeni, founder and CEO of Yardeni Research, has boldly rebranded the Magnificent Seven giants as the “Magnificent One,” referring only to Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) as the key driver of this year’s market gains.

Yardeni noted that the semiconductor giant has rallied by 115% year-to-date, more than three times as much as MetaPlatforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) – the top performer among the “Magnificent Six” – and more than 10 times as much as the broader S&P 500 index, as tracked by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY).

“Nvidia is the only clear beneficiary of the AI boom currently because everyone who wants to play has to pay for the company’s expensive GPU chips,” Yardeni said.

However, he cautioned that the heavy capital expenditures could affect the profitability of Nvidia’s clients, who may not all emerge as winners in the AI competition.

Chart: Nvidia Plays Its Own League In The Year-To-Date Ranking

Economic Implications Of The AI Expansion: The Roaring 2020s

“In our Roaring 2020s scenario, the technology boom should continue to shrug off the Fed and power productivity, economic growth, and the stock market higher.”

Yardeni explained that the Fed's monetary policy is only one of several economic drivers, and they won't need to reduce rates to support economic growth if productivity increases.

Nvidia recently reported an “incredible earnings report,” with quarterly net income surging from $2.0 billion in the previous year to $14.9 billion.

“That further confirms our thesis” of a Roaring 2020s scenario, Yardeni said.

The Wall Street veteran believes the market began to reflect the Roaring 2020s scenario on Nov. 30, 2022, with the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT. Since then, Nvidia has propelled the S&P 500’s semiconductor indexes to new heights.

Yardeni assigns a 60% chance to the Roaring 2020s scenario, contrasting with a 20% probability of a “1990s market meltup” and another 20% of a “1970s repeat.”

“Our Roaring 2020s scenario is right on track,” he said.

Yardeni’s Roaring 2020s scenario anticipates above-average growth in S&P 500 earnings, GDP, and productivity. Increased productivity is expected to reduce unit labor costs and inflation, continuing a trend that started last year. This ongoing trend, as forecasted, should elevate profit margins to unprecedented levels.

Last week, the veteran investor forecasted that the Dow Jones Industrial Average would reach 60,000 points and the S&P 500 would climb to 8,000 by the decade’s end, assuming the Roaring 2020s scenario materializes.

Markets experienced a sharp downturn Thursday afternoon following an initial surge to historic highs in technology-heavy stock indices, driven by Nvidia Corp.‘s (NASDAQ:NVDA) spectacular AI-driven earnings report.

The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), also known as the market fear index, surged over 7% after hitting its lowest level since November 2019 earlier in the session.

Blue-chip stocks were particularly affected in a broad sector selloff. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, tracked by the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSE:DIA), was down 1.5% at 3:00 p.m. in New York, on track for its worst performance since March 2023.

Both the S&P 500, tracked by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), and the Nasdaq 100, monitored through the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ), fell 0.9%.

Chipmakers were the only industry in the green, with the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NYSE:SMH) up 0.8%, thanks to Nvidia’s 8.7% rally.

Chart: Dow Eyes Worst Day In Over A Year

What Happened: Sentiment took a hit after S&P Global released its May private sector activity surveys. The Composite PMI Index, a gauge of overall business health, showed the highest expansion rate in two years.

This might seem like good news, but the devil is in the details.

“Input prices continued to rise sharply in May, with the rate of inflation accelerating to register the second-largest monthly increase seen over the past eight months,” S&P Global reported.

In particular, manufacturers experienced a steep increase, facing the largest cost rise in a year and a half. This was attributed to higher supplier prices for a wide variety of inputs, including metals, chemicals, plastics, and timber-based products, as well as higher energy and labor costs.

Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global, indicated that selling price inflation has increased, continuing to signal modestly above-target inflation.

He highlighted that the primary inflationary pressure now originates from manufacturing rather than services. This shift has resulted in elevated rates of inflation for both costs and selling prices compared to pre-pandemic standards, implying that reaching the “Fed’s 2% target still seems elusive”

Why It Matters: Stronger-than-expected business sentiment growth and renewed inflationary concerns pushed Treasury yields up across the board, leading investors to reassess the likelihood of Fed interest rate cuts.

Notably, there has been a significant shift in rate cut expectations. Fed futures are currently pricing in only 34 basis points of rate cuts by year-end, translating to just one rate cut.

Story continues

While investors had anticipated a rate cut by September as of Wednesday, this expectation has now been postponed to November, according to the CME Group Fed Watch Tool.

The rate-sensitive two-year Treasury yield leaped by 6 basis points to 4.93%, eyeing the highest close since May 1.

The dollar was the only gainer among major asset classes, with the Invesco DB USD Bullish Index Fund ETF (NYSE:UUP), up 0.2%.

On Thursday, Wall Street opened the session with significant milestones as the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 indices surged to new record highs. This rebound was driven by Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), which soared 9% to $1,034 per share following outstanding earnings results and optimistic guidance.

Sector-wise, technology stocks led the gains, with the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLK) increasing by 0.6%.

For investors excited about eventual rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, thinking they'll provide a tail wind for risk assets, a 16 billion dollar hedge fund warns to be mindful of their wish.

Mark Spitznagel is the CIO and founder of the hedge fund Universa, which focuses on risk mitigation in the face of a ‘black swan' event. In an interview with Reuters, Spitznagel calls hopes for a rate cut ""a case of be careful what you wish for.""

Don't Miss:

A startup that turns videos into games gets backing from Mark Cuban, opens a round for regular investors at $250. Startup behind ‘the #1 free contractor app' grows 162% YoY, opens its doors for investors at a $100 minimum.

Nassim Nicholas Taleb, who wrote a book on the topic of black swans right before the 2008 financial crisis and is an advisor to the Universa fund, defines a black swan event as being ""so rare that even the possibility that it might occur is unknown,"" while having ""a catastrophic impact when it does occur"" that can be ""explained in hindsight as if it were actually predictable.""

Part of Mr. Spitznagel's fears stem from how the economy has been conditioned over so many years, benefiting from massive amounts of debt taken out when interest rates were low. He argues that ""this economy is built on low interest rates,"" with ""lag effects when you reset interest rates like we had.""

While investors who have held on to risk assets have benefited from the massive 27% rise in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) since its October 2023 lows, Mark Spitznagel warns that it could reverse quickly, saying ""the fastest, greatest tightening ever, by some regards, into the greatest credit bubble in human history"" is inevitable and that ""when things are going to be really bad [it'll probably be] too late to get out.""

Trending: Invest in time-tested solution that aims to solve this $600 billion women’s health problem at 80 cents per share.

Mr. ​​Spitznagel isn't alone in his concerns about a market getting ahead of itself.

According to Business Insider, market strategists at Stifel Investment Bank predict ""a middle quarters correction for equities"" of 10% due to Fed cuts pushed back even further than expected in the face of continued higher-than-expected inflation.

Even Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK) has been a net seller of stocks of late as they've gone up, predicting at Berkshire's most recent shareholder meeting that Berkshire's cash position will ""probably be at about $200 billion at the end of this quarter"" due to ""only swing[ing] at pitches we like.""

Story continues

However, just because a black swan fund founder sounds the alarm doesn't necessarily mean he's saying to sell everything. Instead, he's warning to be mindful of purchasing portfolio ""insurance,"" such as his fund offers. Mr. Spitznagel assures: ""I’m not a permabear. I’ve been as positive on this market as I could possibly have been in the last year and a half.""

It’s a rather quiet session on Tuesday, with major U.S. averages trading around the flatline at midday trading in New York.

Traders remained on the sidelines ahead of Wednesday’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting minutes and Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) earnings report.

Tuesday saw Federal Reserve officials making public statements with mixed messages.

Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said he expects inflation to decline but at a slow pace, and he does not foresee a rate cut before the fourth quarter.

Board member Christopher J. Waller, on a more dovish note, said the risk of inflation reaccelerating is off the table and he does not expect a rate hike.

Sectors and industries were little moved, with financials and solar stocks slightly outperforming.

Small caps softened, with the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE:IWM) falling 0.3%. Treasury yields inched lower, with the benchmark 10-year yield dropping 4 basis points to 4.41%, on track to snap a three-straight session of yield gains.

Metal commodities paused for a breather, after both gold and copper hit fresh record highs on Monday. Crude oil fell 1.6%.

In the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) fell 2.2% to $69,900, reflecting some waning investor sentiment toward risky assets.

Wall Street kicked off the new week on a high note, with all major U.S. indices posting gains and reaching fresh record highs by midday trading in New York, as the bull market momentum remains strong.

The S&P 500 index surged to 5,325 points during the session, matching last Thursday’s all-time high. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 climbed past 18,670 points, setting new record highs. The Dow Jones remained steady at 40,000, its highest level ever.

Treasury yields saw little movement, with the 10-year benchmark hovering at 4.44%. Markets appeared to brush off some hawkish remarks from the Federal Reserve.

Federal Reserve Vice President Michael Barr noted that first-quarter inflation was disappointing and did not provide the confidence needed to ease monetary policy, emphasizing the necessity of allowing tight policy more time to work. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly expressed that she is not yet confident inflation is sustainably decreasing to 2%. In a softer tone, Vice Chair Philip Jefferson highlighted that the policy is in restrictive territory and that he is cautiously optimistic about continuing the fight against inflation while keeping the economy strong.

Michael Burry, the legendary investor who famously predicted the 2008 financial crisis, has once again made headlines with his latest 13F filing for his hedge fund Scion Asset Management LLC.

The first quarter of 2024 reveals a strategic recalibration towards physical commodities and renewable energy, while Burry shifted away from some tech giants.

The total market value of Scion's 13F securities increased from $94.6 million to $103.49 million. The fund’s activity included five new purchases, additions to 11 existing positions, and complete sell-offs of 14 stocks.

Top 5 Buys: A Golden Bet On Gold And Clean Energy

Burry's top buys for Q1 2024 reveal a clear pivot towards physical precious metals and clean energy, underscoring his anticipation of rising value in these sectors.

Leading the charge is the Sprott Physical Gold Trust ETV (NYSE:PHYS), with Scion increasing its position by $7.62 million, marking a 7.37% change in the portfolio. This substantial investment highlights Burry's confidence in gold as a hedge against economic uncertainty. The aforementioned gold fund has delivered a 16% return year to date, outperforming the broader stock market, as tracked by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), which rose by 12%.

Next in line is Cigna Holding Co (NYSE:CL), where Scion increased its stake by $7.26 million, representing a 7.02% portfolio change. This move reflects Burry's continued belief in the resilience and growth potential of the healthcare sector.

Reflecting confidence in the energy sector, Burry added $6.59 million worth of BP Plc ADR (NYSE:BP), translating to a 6.37% portfolio change. This investment signifies Burry’s recognition of BP’s strong position in the global energy market, especially amid BP’s transition to cleaner energy sources.

Last week, the British energy company’s electric vehicle charging unit announced plans to acquire Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) supercharging sites in the US as part of its expansion efforts.

Burry's commitment to renewable energy is further emphasized by a $5.06 million increase in First Solar Inc. (NYSE:FSLR), representing a 4.89% change in the portfolio. This move aligns with the global shift towards sustainable energy solutions, showcasing Burry's foresight in capitalizing on this growing trend.

Rounding out the top five buys is Baidu Inc ADR (NASDAQ:BIDU), with a $4.38 million addition, marking a 4.07% portfolio change. This investment underscores Burry’s confidence in the long-term potential of Chinese technology companies.

In his Q4 2023 13F filing, Burry increased stakes in two major Chinese retail giants, JD.com Inc (NASDAQ:JD) and Alibaba Group Holdings (NASDAQ:BABA).

Story continues

At the end of the first quarter 2024, Burry further increased his stakes in these two giants, purchasing an additional 160,000 shares of JD.com and 50,000 shares of Alibaba.

Top 5 Portfolio Divestments: Burry Trims Tech Giants

Burry made notable divestments in several high-profile tech stocks during the first quart.

Oracle Corp (NASDAQ:ORCL) tops the list, with Scion decreasing its holdings by $5.77 million, a 5.57% change in the portfolio.

CVS Health Corp (CVS) followed closely, with a $5.62 million reduction, a 5.43% change in the portfolio. This move might reflect concerns over potential challenges in the healthcare sector.

Nexstar Media Group (NASDAQ:NXST) ranked third in terms of largest sales, with Burry reducing the stake by $5.57 million (5.39% change).

Notably, Burry opted to completely exit his positions in two major U.S. tech giants, suggesting a reevaluation of their growth prospects following a strong rally.

Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) saw a full divestment, with Burry selling $5.35 million worth of shares (a 5.17% change).

Similarly, Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) experienced a complete exit, with a $4.99 million reduction, representing a 4.82% portfolio change. This move highlights Burry's cautious stance on the future performance of one of the world's largest e-commerce platforms.

Portfolio Summary

The top five holdings by weight in the Scion Asset Management LLC’s portfolio by the end of the Q1 2024 are:

JD.com Inc: 9.53%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd: by 8.74%. HCA Healthcare Inc (NYSE:HCA): 8.06%. Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C): 7.64%. Sprott Physical Gold Trust: 7.37%.

The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 indices rose to fresh record highs during morning trading on Wednesday following a broadly in-line inflation report and cooler-than-expected retail sales data for April, as traders increased their rate cut bets.

Inflation calculated on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) basket came in at 3.4% year-on-year in April 2024, matching estimates and snapping a streak of three consecutive months of hotter-than-expected readings.

Market-implied probabilities on the Federal Reserve enacting a rate cut as early as September 2024 rose to over 70%, according to CME Group’s FedWatch Tool. Cumulatively, traders are now fully pricing in two rate cuts of 25 basis points by year end.

The rate-sensitive 2-year Treasury yields tumbled to 4.75%, down by 7 basis points, marking a notable break below its 200-day moving average.

The U.S. dollar fell across the board vis-à-vis other major currencies, with the greenback losing as much as 1% against the low-yielding Japanese yen.

Among sectors, both tech and real estate rallied the most, given their high sensitivity to interest rates. Top industry performers were homebuilders, as tracked by the iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (NYSE:ITB), up 3.2%. Chipmakers, as tracked by the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NYSE:SMH) followed suit, up 2.2%.

Small caps, as tracked by the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE:IWM), also rallied, up by 1%.

Meme-tied stocks, such as AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (NYSE:AMC) and GameStop Inc. (NYSE:GME), plummeted 23% and 31%, respectively. Wednesday’s negative price actions caused the two stocks to retrace more than half of the wild bullish trend that began on Monday.

In the commodities space, precious metals soared with gold and silver up 1.3% and 3%, respectively. Crude softened 0.3%.

Among cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) marked a 5.5% gain.

Wall Street is experiencing a subdued trading session, with all major indices showing minimal movement around midday in New York. The latest producer inflation data provided mixed signals ahead of the highly anticipated consumer inflation report on Wednesday.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated his outlook that U.S. monetary policy will maintain its current rate for a longer period than previously anticipated, dismissing fears of new rate hikes.

President Joe Biden announced significant tariffs on Chinese imports, imposing 25% on steel and aluminum, 100% on electric vehicles made in China, 25% on EV batteries, and a 50% tariff on semiconductors from China.

The U.S. dollar index (DXY), the Invesco DB USD Index Bullish Fund ETF (NYSE:UUP), fell 0.2% negatively reacting to producer inflation readings and Powell’s remarks.

Treasury yields slightly softened, with traders holding expectations of two Fed rate cuts by year-end.

All major indices such as the S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq 100 traded broadly flat for the day.

Small caps, as tracked by the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE:IWM), rallied 0.8%, on track to notch the highest close since early April.

During a discussion with Dutch Central Bank President Klaas Knot in Amsterdam, Fed Chair Jerome Powell reinforced his stance that U.S. monetary policy will likely maintain its current rate for a more extended period than previously anticipated, aiming to further reduce inflation towards the Fed’s 2% target.

Likewise, Powell dismissed the risks of new rate hikes, echoing his remarks from the May Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) press conference.

Responding to an audience question about the likelihood of future rate hikes, Powell suggested, based on current data, “the next move that we make would be more likely to hold the policy rate where it is,” rather than increasing it.

Labor Market Is Still Very Strong

Powell praised the recent performance of the U.S. economy, noting, “The U.S. economy has been performing very well lately.” He attributed this strength to a robust labor market characterized by rising employment and wages, leading to increased consumer spending.

“Households are in good shape financially,” he observed, emphasizing they are not overly leveraged, which supports continued economic health.

The Fed Chair also highlighted the significant role of immigration in bolstering the economy over the past few years, adding to the overall positive outlook. Business investment has been another area of strength, with companies capitalizing on opportunities to expand.

Reflecting on the labor market, Powell described it as “very, very strong,” noting that it had cooled from its overheated state a few years ago to a more balanced condition. “The labor market is about as tight as it was before the pandemic in 2019,” he stated, highlighting that real wages are now positive and unemployment has remained below 4% for 27 consecutive months — a rare occurrence over the past half-century.

Inflation Still Requires Caution, PPI “Mixed”

Despite the strong labor market, Powell acknowledged the path to lowering inflation was not smooth.

“We had higher readings in the first quarter and higher than we expected,” he admitted. This situation underscored the need for patience, allowing the restrictive monetary policy to take effect gradually.

Powell remarked on the significant progress made in combating inflation: “We’ve made real progress on inflation. We’re far lower than we were.” He initially feared reducing the high inflation rates could lead to a significant decline in employment and economic weakening, which, fortunately, did not occur.

Despite these improvements, Powell recognized the public’s discontent, primarily because “prices are high” when shopping, which impacts the overall sentiment.

Story continues

He described the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) as “mixed,” with higher headline numbers but also some backward revisions that require careful analysis.

Powell noted businesses still report labor shortages, which are now being addressed, but may take time to reflect in broader economic indicators and inflation metrics. He expressed confidence that inflation would eventually stabilize at the 2% target, emphasizing, “I am confident that we will get inflation down to 2%.”

“I think by many, many measures the policy rate is restrictive. The question is it sufficiently restrictive and I think that’s going to be a question that time will have to tell,” he stated.

Market Reactions

The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), which tracks the S&P 500 Index, experienced volatile trading during Powell’s press remarks. Initially, the broader stock market fell due to expectations that interest rates would remain higher for an extended period. However, it later rebounded after Powell dismissed the possibility of new interest rate hikes.

The Invesco DB USD Index Bullish Fund ETF (NYSE:UUP), which follows the U.S. Dollar Index, did not manage to rebound from its decline following the mixed Producer Price Index (PPI) report. Treasury yields softened throughout the day, with the 10-year yield decreasing to 4.47%.

The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD), which tracks the price of gold, maintained its gains for the session, with an ounce of the precious metal changing hands at $2,350 per ounce, marking a 0.7% increase for the day.

Warren Buffett, the legendary investor and chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, has been a long-standing advocate of safe investment options. The majority of his wealth comes from investments in different industries, while his total equity portfolio is valued at a whopping $347 billion.

Though Buffett’s investment prowess has often been associated with his adept stock-picking skills, his persistent advocacy for index funds sheds light on a simple yet powerful strategy for investors.

The Oracle of Omaha only has 41 stocks in his portfolio, out of which two are S&P 500 Exchange-traded funds (ETFs). He holds nearly 40,000 shares of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), valued at approximately $18.73 million. He has also maintained a stake in the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:VOO), holding 43,000 shares valued at $18.78 million.

""In my view, for most people, the best thing to do is own the S&P 500 index fund,"" Buffett had once said. ""The trick is not to pick the right company. The trick is to essentially buy all the big companies through the S&P 500 and to do it consistently and to do it in a very, very low-cost way,"" he further added.

Don’t Miss:

Warren Buffett once said, ""If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die."" Here's how you can collect passive rental income without being a landlord. Miami is expected to take New York's place as the U.S. Financial Capital. Here's how you can invest in the city with as little as $500 before that happens.

Why Does Buffett Like Index ETFs So Much?

Buffett’s rationale behind endorsing S&P 500 index funds is rooted in their simplicity and effectiveness. He argues that attempting to outperform the market is futile for most investors, and instead, they should seek exposure to the broad U.S. stock market through low-cost index funds.

""The record shows that the unmanaged index fund is going to do quite well over time and active investment as a group can't beat it,"" Buffett once said.

Despite the macroeconomic headwinds, Buffett believes the U.S. economy will bounce back over the long run.

""The temptation when you see bad headlines in newspapers is to say, well, maybe I should skip a year or something. Just keep buying,"" Buffett said during the 2017 annual shareholders meeting. ""American business is going to do fine over time, so you know the investment universe is going to do very well.""

Story continues

Buffett’s investment philosophy, characterized by simplicity and discipline, has yielded remarkable results over the years. Despite his exceptional ability to select winning stocks, he emphasizes the value of a diversified investment portfolio, warning against unnecessary risks. His recommendation to consistently invest in low-cost index funds, especially during market volatility, resonates with investors of all levels of experience.

Are Index ETFs Worth It?

ETFs like S&P 500 index funds have gained popularity among investors due to their cost-effectiveness and liquidity. They offer diversification at a fraction of the cost of actively managed funds, making them an attractive option for those seeking steady wealth accumulation.

Despite the allure, Buffett highlighted the importance of keeping the total cost of investment low so as not to eat away at gains. The expense ratio, which denotes the cost of managing the fund, is a crucial factor.

For instance,  SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust comes with an expense ratio of 0.095%, while Vanguard S&P 500 ETF charges 0.03%. Over the long term, these seemingly small fees can significantly impact investors’ overall returns.

""Costs really matter in investments,"" Buffett said, ""If returns are going to be seven or eight percent and you're paying one percent for fees, that makes an enormous difference in how much money you're going to have in retirement.""

Beyond Stocks and Bonds: Preparing for Uncertain Times

There's been a lot of talk about a market downturn in the near future, with many experts warning that the stock market is in for a rough ride. Warren Buffett has even begun taking defensive measures by increasing Berkshire Hathaway's cash position as the economy becomes more unpredictable.

Physical assets, such as real estate, are well-regarded as a strong hedge against recession. Real estate has the ability to provide consistent cash flow, ensuring your portfolio continues to produce returns. One of the most stable types of real estate is single-family rentals. No matter what's happening in the market, people need a place to live and will always prioritize paying rent.

Arrived, an investment platform backed by Amazon.com Inc. founder Jeff Bezos, allows individual investors to own shares of rental properties that pay out monthly cash dividends. Investors can become fractional owners in properties they choose while Arrived handles the management responsibilities.

The platform has already funded more than 370 homes and paid out nearly $6 million in dividends to investors. It takes about 10 minutes to get set up, and the minimum investment is only $100, meaning you could own a cash-flowing rental property today.

Analysts are optimistic about Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) as the streaming company gears up for its Upfront presentation on May 16.

JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth reiterated an Overweight rating on Netflix stock with a price target of $650, citing several factors driving the stock’s recent rebound.

Netflix Stock Rebound

Chart: Benzinga Pro

After initially dropping post-earnings on April 18, Netflix shares have rallied back to their pre-earnings price, outperforming the S&P 500, as represented by the iShares S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:SPY).

Anmuth believes this rebound is due to increased comfort with Netflix’s 2024 revenue outlook and its decision to no longer report subscribers starting in 2025.

He also pointed to the “recognition that NFLX is not subject to heavy AI-driven capex intensity like META, GOOGL, & AMZN Unlike some competitors,” as a factor driving this rebound.

Ad Tier Expectations

Anmuth expects the Upfront presentation to bring updates on several key areas.

One focus will be on the Ad tier, with expectations for an update on the 23 million+ ad tier monthly active users (MAUs). Conversations suggest investors are looking for 35-40 million+ ad tier MAUs, including the benefit of the T-Mobile bundle.

Ad tier subscriptions have grown significantly, with over 40% of sign-ups now opting for the ad-supported tier.

Advertising remains a key area of growth for Netflix, highlighted Anmuth, with the company expected to drive Ad tier growth through bundles, pricing changes, and marketing efforts.

Anmuth projects Ad tier subs to reach 28 million by the end of 2024 and 39 million by the end of 2025.

“Advertising remains a drag on ARM as monetization lags inventory & scale growth, but ad sales will build over time [and] Netflix expects the Ad tier to become a more meaningful revenue driver in 2025 & beyond,” he said.

Netflix’s Content Slate & Sports Strategy

Aside from ad tier updates, investors are also looking for news on Netflix’s content slate and sports strategy.

There are suggestions that Netflix could host two NFL games on Christmas later this year, potentially boosting the ad tier and promoting upcoming content.

Anmuth notes that Peacock’s NFL playoff game this past season reportedly cost around $110 million.

Overall, JPMorgan remains positive on Netflix shares, citing a bullish thesis including:

revenue growth acceleration, operating margin expansion, and multi-year free cash flow ramp.

Editor’s note: This story has been updated to correct an error in the price action of Charter Communications stock.

A worse-than-expected University of Michigan May consumer report halted stock gains on Friday, sparking worries about a potential decline in consumer health amid perceived rising price pressures.

The report disclosed that both near-term and long-term inflation expectations have surged beyond projections this month, causing the broader consumer gauge to hit its lowest levels in six months.

“If spending slows down and inflation increases, we'll get the opposite of the Goldilocks scenario that many were hoping for, and the Fed will be in an especially difficult position of choosing between accommodating a slowing economy and fighting increasing inflation expectations,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance.

Echoing this view, Jeffrey Roach, chief economist for LPL Financial, sees rising risks of stagflation, a concern that could unsettle markets.

At 12:05 p.m. trading in New York, the S&P 500 was 0.1% lower, but it was firmly up by 1.6% for the week, poised to secure a third consecutive week of gains after three of losses.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was a tad higher, battling to secure the eight straight session of gains, the longest positive streak since December 2023. Tech stocks were flat. Small caps were the underperformers, with the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE:IWM) down 0.9%.

The rising inflation perceptions in the consumer survey rescued the dollar, which eyes a positive weekly close, after two negative ones.

Treasury yields also inched higher by about 4 basis points across all maturities. The 10-year benchmark hit 4.5%.

Gold surged to $2,385/oz, with the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) up 0.8%.

The dismal consumer sentiment data sharply weighed on Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) with the largest cryptocurrency dropping over 4% from $63,000 to below $60,500 following the report.

The latest University of Michigan report shows a troubling drop in U.S. consumer confidence, signaling potential weakness in household finances alongside a worrying increase in consumer inflation expectations.

“Consumer sentiment retreated about 13% this May following three consecutive months of very little change. This 10 index-point decline is statistically significant and brings sentiment to its lowest reading in about six months,” Surveys of Consumers Director Joanne Hsu, said.

UMich Consumer Sentiment Report For May: Key Highlights

The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index eased from 77.9 in April to 66.5 in May, missing expectations of 76, according to preliminary data. It marks the lowest level in consumer sentiment since November 2023. The sub-index for consumer expectations tumbled from 76 to 66.5, well below the expected 75. The sub-index for current conditions fell from 79 to 68.8, hitting a 6-month low, missing the predicted 79. The year-ahead inflation expectations rose further from 3.2% to 3.5%, topping the 3.2% expected. Long-term inflation expectations rose from 3.1%.

Economist Takeaways

According to Hsu, “Consumers in western states exhibited a particularly steep drop. While consumers had been reserving judgment for the past few months, they now perceive negative developments on a number of dimensions.”

She emphasized that consumers are expressing concerns about the possibility of inflation, unemployment, and interest rates all trending unfavorably in the upcoming year.

“Year-ahead inflation expectations rose from 3.2% last month to 3.5% this month, remaining above the 2.3-3.0% range seen in the two years prior to the pandemic. Long-run inflation expectations remain elevated relative to the 2.2-2.6% range seen in the two years pre-pandemic,” she added.

Market Reactions

Stocks slightly trimmed daily gains following the release of the University of Michigan’s Consumer Sentiment report.

The S&P 500 index, as tracked by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), was 0.3% higher at 10:08 a.m. in New York, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100, as monitored through the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ), rose 0.5%.

The dollar saw a marginal uptick, aided by the hotter-than-forecasted consumer expectations data. Treasury yields were slightly higher on Friday, sending bond-related ETFs, such as the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT), lower.

Wall Street is seeing a day of gains as all major indices traded in the green around noon in New York, driven by a surprising uptick in unemployment claims prompting speculation over Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.

Jobless benefits rose from 209,000 to 231,000 in the week ending May 4, surpassing market expectations of 210,000 and reaching the highest level in eight months.

Consequently, the U.S. dollar Index (DXY), tracked by the Invesco DB USD Index Bullish Fund ETF (NYSE:UUP), declined by 0.2% in reaction to the data, as market participants slightly increased bets on a September Fed cut.

The S&P 500 index inched up by 0.1%, following Wednesday’s flat close, while blue chips of the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.4%, aiming for their seventh consecutive day of gains, the longest streak since December 2023.

Small caps, tracked by the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE:IWM), increased by 0.5%.

Gold surged by 1% and silver by 2.8% due to the lower dollar. Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) saw a 1.4% increase.

Elsewhere, the Bank of England kept interest rates unchanged, while flagging rising chances of imminent rate cuts as new inflation projections reveal that price pressures will fall below target in two years.

A seismic shift is currently underway among the world’s largest exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which could redefine the landscape of the ETF universe.

The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), the largest ETF globally with over $500 billion in assets under management, experienced significant outflows since the beginning of the year.

In contrast, its lower-cost peers, especially the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:VOO), saw an influx of investments.

What’s driving this trend?

Outflows From SPY ETF On The Rise

The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust witnessed outflows totaling $28 billion since the year’s start, according to data from Vettafi.

This shift is notable because it occurs against a backdrop where the U.S. stock market has been on the rise, indicating that the performance of the underlying investments isn’t the cause of the outflows.

The primary driver behind this shift appeared to be the cost associated with managing these funds, rather than their performance.

SPY has an expense ratio of 0.09%, significantly higher than some of its direct competitors. Even a few basis points can make a considerable difference in investor returns over time, especially for institutional or very large individual investors.

Inflows In Lower-Cost Peers

While SPY has been seeing outflows, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF welcomed inflows of $33 billion during the same period. Another competitor, iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:IVV), attracted $14.53 billion.

These ETFs track the same index as SPY and have nearly identical portfolios.

The distinguishing factor is their expense ratios: the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF and the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF charge just 0.03%, compared to SPY's 0.09%.

Should You Switch From SPY to VOO?

Although a difference of 0.06% in expense ratios might seem negligible, it becomes significant with larger investments or over extended periods.

For instance, on a $10,000 investment, choosing VOO over SPY saves an investor $6 annually. However, for a $10 million investment, the annual savings jump to $6,000.

To illustrate the long-term impact, consider an investor who starts with a $100,000 investment in an S&P 500 fund. Assuming an average annual return of 7%, after 20 years, this investment would grow to $384,803 with VOO, compared to $380,509 with SPY, due to the difference in expense ratios.

Over time, these seemingly small differences can result in substantial divergences in end wealth, due to the effect of compounding returns.

Thus, for individual investors, particularly those with substantial amounts or long investment horizons, the cost savings from ETFs associated with lower expense ratios should not be overlooked.

If a person was considering a switch from SPY to VOO, it’s essential to weigh these factors along with any potential tax implications or transaction costs associated with such a move.

For many, the long-term savings on fees could justify the switch, enhancing overall returns while keeping the same portfolio structure.

Yet, if a person had significant holdings in the SPY, they need to consider the tax costs associated with selling their shares. To avoid these potential tax liabilities, maintain the investment in SPY and start diverting new funds into a more cost-effective ETF, such as the VOO or the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV).

The number of individuals filing for unemployment benefits soared more than predicted last week, suggesting emerging weaknesses in the labor market.

Jobless claims rose from 209,000 to 231,000 for the week that ended on May 4, marking the highest level since August of the previous year, according to data released by the Department of Labor. This rise ended a sequence of four weeks when the figures were consistently below expectations, and it was higher than the anticipated 210,000 print.

The four-week moving average of initial claims, which reduces the volatility of weekly data, increased by 4,750, reaching 215,000. On an unadjusted basis, the claims went up by 19,690 to 209,324, with notable increases in several states: New York saw an increase of 10,248, California 4,198, Indiana 2,439, and Illinois 2,003.

These figures strengthen the perception that the U.S. labor market’s momentum is diminishing, as highlighted by the recent employment report, which indicated a slower-than-expected growth in nonfarm employment and a surprising increase in the unemployment rate.

Market reactions

Following the release of the unemployment claims data, the U.S. Dollar saw a significant drop. The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), tracked by the Invesco DB USD Index Bullish Fund ETF (NYSE:UUP), decreased by 0.3%.

Expectations for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts increased, with the probability of a cut in September rising to 67.9% and with traders now fully pricing in two rate cuts by the end of the year.

Rate-sensitive 2-year Treasury yields moved slightly lower to 4.82%,

Stocks edged higher in the first hour of trading in New York. The S&P 500, tracked by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), was up 0.2%.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average outperformed, with an increase of 0.3%, while the Nasdaq 100 and the Russell 2000 remained flat.

Wednesday witnessed a tempering of the bullish sentiment that had buoyed Wall Street in recent sessions, with major indices showing slight declines around midday trading in New York.

Hawkish remarks from Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari and Boston Fed President Susan Collins sparked concerns among investors about the potential delay in rate cuts, as the likelihood of enduring higher interest rates gained traction.

Kashkari asserted that the Fed would likely need to maintain borrowing costs at current levels for an extended period, potentially throughout the year, and did not rule out rate hikes if inflation remained stubbornly high at 3%.

Collins echoed similar sentiments, suggesting that a slowdown in economic growth would be necessary to bring inflation closer to the Fed’s 2% target, cautioning against premature rate cuts.

The S&P 500, as tracked by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), edged down by 0.2%, striving for a fifth consecutive day of gains, which would mark the longest winning streak since late January.

The Nasdaq 100 also slipped by 0.2%, while blue-chip stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average marginally managed to avoid losses. However, small-cap stocks were the laggards of the day, with the Russell 2000 Index declining by 0.9%.

In the commodities market, the Energy Information Administration’s report of a decline in crude oil inventories last week led to a modest 0.6% increase in West Texas Intermediate prices. Gold prices remained steady, while silver experienced a modest uptick of 0.6%.

Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) traded flat at $62,300.

Similar to how Morgan Stanley's (NYSE:MS) stock lately has underperformed many of its banking peers, its Chief Investment Officer Mike Wilson has significantly underperformed other market prognosticators.

Wilson has gotten so many market forecasts wrong over the past few years that he's effectively given up even trying to predict their future movements.

Don't Miss:

This Uber-for-moving startup is quietly taking the world by storm, here’s how anyone can invest for a limited time. Invest in time-tested solution that aims to solve this $600 billion women’s health problem at 80 cents per share.

After successfully calling for the 2022 market selloff during market euphoria in September 2021, Wilson announced he would no longer make index-level calls, attributing his mistakes as being in ""a humbling business"" and that he now spends more time looking at specific companies.

Popular financial X user Barchart mocked Wilson's failed market forecasts, recently posting ""after being wrong about everything over the last 18 months, Wilson has decided to no longer make bold predictions about the S&P 500.""

While he retains his CIO position, Morgan Stanley said in an internal memo in February that Wilson would be leaving the firm's Global Investment Committee.Chief Operating Officer Jed Finn said Wilson would ""focus on serving his key institutional clients, where the demand for generating tactical alpha is intensifying.""

Trending: Amid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity.

Morgan Stanley's Wealth Management division has recently brought negative attention to the firm. It is the target of a multiagency probe that includes the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and other Treasury Department offices.

The investigation stems from concerns that Morgan Stantley's know your client (KYC) procedures may be inadequate. Wilson was hired as CIO of Morgan Stanley's Wealth Management division in 2012.

While some investors and traders can be keen to follow Wall Street's short-term predictions, it may be worth remembering the famous quote by Fisher Investments Chairman Kenneth Fisher, who said, ""Time in the market beats timing the market.""

The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), the ETF that tracks the S&P 500 index, is up about 72% over the past five years and over 1,000% since 1993.

Wall Street experienced a quiet session during morning trading on Tuesday, influenced by a lack of significant economic data and minimal updates on earnings from major large-cap companies.

Traders largely disregarded the latest hawkish comments from Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, who noted progress on inflation seen in the latter half of 2023 had stalled and mentioned the Federal Reserve might raise rates if inflation becomes persistent.

Kashkari also revealed he initially predicted two rate cuts for the year, but now anticipated possibly maintaining two, or reducing to one or none by the June Summary of Economic Projections.

The S&P 500 saw a modest increase of 0.2% around midday in New York, with similar gains in the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 and the Dow Jones, all of which are poised for their fourth consecutive session of gains. The iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE:IWM), representing small caps, performed notably well, rising 0.8%.

Treasury yields declined slightly by about 6 basis points across various maturities from 5 to 30 years, with the 10-year benchmark decreasing to 4.4%, marking a fifth consecutive day of declines. This led to a continued rally in bonds, exemplified by a 1.1% increase in the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT).

In corporate news, chipmaker Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) saw its shares drop over 13% following weaker-than-expected guidance. Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) also fell sharply by over 10%, setting it on course for its worst performance day since November 2022.

In the cryptocurrency and precious metals markets, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) remained stable at $63,800, while both gold and silver declined by 0.5%

As we enter May, the old Wall Street adage “sell in May and go away” is finding its way back into the conversations of traders and investors.

The strategy suggests the stock market tends to underperform from May through October compared to the November through April period.

A deeper dive into historical data and market trends suggests the trade may not always be the wisest course of action.

Sell In May And Go Away: Historical Performance

The sell in May and go away strategy is rooted in historical stock market patterns.

George Smith, a portfolio strategist at LPL Financials, highlights that since 1950, the May-October period has been the weakest six-month cycle in the stock market. In contrast, the November-April period sees far stronger stock returns.

“Unless investors can seek superior returns in other asset classes, being out of the equity market may not have been the best strategy,” Smith says.

The expert remarks that average returns for the S&P 500 index during the May-October months have remained positive, recording 1.8% gains since 1950 and approximately 4.4% over the last five and 10 years.

The S&P 500 Index has recorded a cumulative six-month average gain of 6.7% in the period between November to April, the Corporate Finance Institute (CFI) finds.

Andrew Loo, vice president of Capital Markets at CFI, highlights that the May to October interval generally sees subdued market optimism. This downturn follows the conclusion of first-quarter results and coincides with a seasonal decline in market attention as individuals take summer vacations.

Additionally, Loo says that during election years, the stock market often experiences a slump in September and October, primarily due to the uncertainties surrounding election outcomes.

Sell In May And Go Away In Elections Years: Myth Debunked

Contrary to popular belief, presidential election years do not necessarily equate to increased market volatility.

Rocky White, senior quantitative analyst at Schaeffer’s Research, says the six-month returns leading to November presidential election have been rather positive.

During presidential election years, the average return for the S&P 500 index is notably higher at 4.67%, compared to only 0.95% in midterm election years and 2.14% in non-election years.

Presidential election years have the highest rate of positive returns at 89%, significantly higher than the 63% seen in both midterm and non-election years.

This suggests that the May-October window in a presidential election year tends to be more favorable for the stock market.

6-Month S&P 500 Returns Are Even Better With Incumbent President In The Race

White also notes that during presidential election years with an incumbent candidate, the S&P 500 has performed exceptionally well in the six months leading up to the ballots.

Since 1948, the index has averaged returns of 7.57%, with 91% of returns being positive. In stark contrast, years without an incumbent have barely broken even, with the 2008 financial crisis heavily skewing the averages.

In the last U.S. presidential election, the S&P 500 index, as tracked by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), rallied by over 20% in the six months leading up to the Nov. 3, 2020 vote. In that case, the incumbent running was Donald Trump.

Benzinga’s Take: Several studies suggests the decision to “sell in May and go away” may be overly simplistic and potentially disadvantageous for investors.

With historical data showing positive average returns even during the traditionally weaker months, and election years not necessarily exacerbating market volatility, a blanket strategy of exiting the stock market right away may not be prudent.

Warren Buffett, arguably one of the most successful investors of the 21st century, has amassed a wealth of $131 billion, making him the seventh richest person on this planet as of April 30.

Buffett’s Sage Advice: Don’t Take Unnecessary Risk

During the annual shareholders meeting in 2017, Buffett reiterated his long-standing belief in the simplicity of investing, stating, “If they told everybody what a simple game [investing] was, 90% of the income of the people that were speaking would disappear.” Despite his vast success in owning businesses, Buffett has consistently emphasized the value of a diversified investment portfolio, advising against unnecessary risks.

Buffett’s philosophy underscores the significance of consistently investing in low-cost index funds, especially during market volatility. His recommendation to “consistently buy an S&P 500 low-cost index fund” has resonated with both seasoned investors and beginners alike.

“Keep buying it through thick and thin and especially through thin,” Buffett emphasized in 2017, highlighting the importance of discipline and perseverance in wealth accumulation. “I think it’s the thing that makes the most sense practically all of the time,” Buffett added.

ETFs: The Simple Passive Investment Tool

Investing in S&P 500 index funds like SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) is one of the easiest and most effective strategies. It allows investors to benefit from the soaring stock market while remaining shielded from the unnecessary risk that mid- and small-cap companies are typically exposed to.

“The trick is not to pick the right company, the trick is to essentially buy all the big companies through the S&P 500 and to do it consistently and to do it in a very, very low-cost way,” Buffett stated.

Exchange-traded funds have become popular among investors, largely due to their cost-effectiveness. ETFs typically have lower expense ratios, making them an attractive option for cost-conscious investors. These funds are designed to track the performance of a specific index, commodity, or basket of assets, offering diversification at a fraction of the cost of actively managed funds.

The appeal of ETFs is further enhanced by their liquidity, as they can be bought and sold throughout the trading day at market prices, providing investors with flexibility and accessibility. Buffett’s endorsement of index funds as the holy grail in this era of uncertainty reflects his belief in their long-term potential to generate wealth steadily.

“Costs really matter in investments,” Buffett added. “If returns are going to be seven or eight percent and you’re paying one percent for fees, that makes an enormous difference in how much money you’re going to have in retirement.”

Amidst fluctuating market conditions and economic uncertainties, Buffett’s advice serves as a beacon of stability for investors seeking to navigate the complexities of the financial landscape.

“The temptation when you see bad headlines in newspapers is to say, well, maybe I should skip a year or something. Just keep buying,” Buffett said further during the 2017 annual shareholders meeting. “American business is going to do fine over time, so you know the investment universe is going to do very well.”

A New Approach To The Index Fund Model

Cityfunds offers a unique twist on the traditional index fund model by focusing on real estate investments in specific markets. Each Cityfund is a diversified portfolio of Home Equity Investments (HEIs) in a particular city, allowing investors to gain exposure to that market’s growth potential.

As the value of the properties within a Cityfund appreciates, so should the value of the fund’s shares. This innovative approach unlocks the $32.6 trillion home equity market, which has grown by an impressive 211% since 2013, making it accessible to individual investors for the first time. By investing in Cityfunds, individuals can benefit from the potential upside of the real estate market while enjoying the diversification and risk-adjusted returns that come with investing in a portfolio of carefully vetted properties.

Some of the markets available to invest in through Cityfunds are Miami, Los Angeles, Dallas, Austin, Phoenix and more high-growth cities. Click here to explore Cityfunds’s offerings.

As April comes to a close, it’s time to compile the rankings for the top-performing sector and industry exchange-traded funds of the month.

Taking a broader look at the stock market, the S&P 500 Index, represented by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), finished April on a downturn, declining by approximately 3%. This marks the end of a five-month streak of gains.

Similarly, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100, tracked by the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ), experienced a 3.5% decline.

Among large-cap indices, blue-chip stocks showed slight underperformance, with the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSE:DIA) slipping by 4.5%.

Small-cap stocks, represented by the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE:IWM), plummeted by over 6%, marking their worst performance since October 2023.

Overall, it has been a challenging month for the stock market, primarily due to inflation surprises surpassing expectations. This has led to a recalibration of market expectations regarding potential Federal Reserve rate cuts.

Additionally, complex global geopolitical tensions have emerged, notably between Israel and Iran, alongside the ongoing issue in the Gaza Strip.

May is anticipated to start with a crucial event as investors await the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on Wednesday.

While no interest rate changes are expected, all eyes will be on Fed Chair Jerome Powell‘s remarks to assess the Fed’s stance in response to recent inflation surprises.

Performance Of Sector ETFs In April 2024

At the sector level, only the utilities sector managed to avoid losses for the month, rising by 2.1%.

The largest stock contributors to the utilities’ performance in April are NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), The Southern Company (NYSE:SO), Dominion Energy, Inc. (NYSE:D) and NRG Energy (NYSE:NRG) which showed monthly gains between 4% and 8%.

Energy stocks remained broadly stable, while the other nine S&P 500’s sectors showcased losses.

Real estate experienced the worst performance, down by over 7%, dragged down by its high sensitivity to interest rates, as Treasury yields increase across the board during the month.

Following real estate, the technology and healthcare sectors also showed poor performance in April.

The U.S. stock market broke a streak of five consecutive months of gains in April, reigniting concerns about the impact of rising inflationary pressures and the potential for a prolonged restrictive monetary policy by the Federal Reserve.

Despite positive signals from first-quarterearnings reports, all major U.S. indices ended the month in negative territory as macroeconomic fears hit risk sentiment.

The S&P 500, as tracked by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), closed 4% lower, snapping a five-month winning streak and marking its worst performance since September 2023.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100, monitored through the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) witnessed a 4.4% decline for the month, similarly snapping a five-month positive streak and hitting the worst monthly return since September 2023.

Blue chip stocks in the Dow Jones, as tracked by the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSE:DIA), fell 4.9% on the month, marking its lowest performance since September 2022.

Inflation Fears Overshadow Positive Earnings Trends

With nearly half of S&P 500 companies reporting first-quarter 2024 results, 77% of companies revealed a positive EPS surprise, and 60% reported a positive revenue surprise.

However, March’s inflation reports delivered a stark reality check to investors.

The latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed a surge in price pressures from 3.2% year-on-year in February to 3.5% in March 2024, surpassing forecasts of a 3.4% increase.

Another blow came from the Bureau of Economic Analysis’ Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) price index report, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge.

Annual PCE inflation rose from 2.5% in February 2024 to 2.7% year-on-year in March, exceeding forecasts of a 2.6% increase. Additionally, core PCE inflation, which excludes energy and food items, surpassed predictions (2.8% vs. 2.6%).

The policy-sensitive 2-year Treasury yields closed the month above the 5% mark, reaching the highest levels since Nov. 13, 2023.

Bank of America Corp. (NYSE:BAC) analysts recently released a note predicting that the Federal Reserve will only cut rates once this year, compared with their previous prediction of four cuts.

""2024 is starting to look like 2015 but in reverse. Then the Fed signaled hikes it could not deliver; now the Fed may be signaling cuts that the inflation data do not justify,"" Bank of America economist Michael Gapen said in the note. ""The acceleration of inflation this year makes a cut prior to December challenging in our view.""

In 2015, the Fed increased interest rates and reduced support for the American economy, despite a minimal increase in inflation rates of 0.12%.

March saw a 3.5% rise in the consumer price index greater than the 3.2% jump for the 12 months ending in February, driven mainly by significant increases in food and beverage costs, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Juice and drink prices soared by 27.5%, while egg prices climbed by 4.6%.

While 2015 could be viewed as a great buying opportunity for U.S. stocks, with the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) up about 142% from the start of that year to today, others aren't so sure it's the right parallel.

For example, JPMorgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon sees a different, and perhaps more ominous, setup ahead for markets given how much spending is needed to tackle today's pressing issues.

Specifically, he shares his view that ""$2 trillion of fiscal deficit, the infrastructure and IRA act, the green economy, the remilitarization of the world, the restructuring of trade are all inflationary,” with that looking “like the 1970s to me.""

Reflecting on whether investors are ready for higher-than-expected inflation, Dimon ominously said he's ""not sure.""

Meanwhile, the Fed seems to be delaying any interest rate cuts until inflation is more manageable.

In an interview with Bloomberg on April 15, Federal Reserve Bank of New York President and CEO John Williams said, ""We will need to start a process at some point to bring interest rates back to more normal levels, and my own view is that process will likely start this year.""

Rising Treasury yields have investors cautious despite positive news from the earnings season.

The yield on the long-dated 30-year Treasury bond has surged to 4.79%. It’s on track to close at the highest level since early November, ahead of crucial economic data on Thursday.

The iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT) fell 0.9%, extending its year-to-date drop to 10%.

Rising yields are propelling the greenback higher, particularly against the low-yielding Japanese yen which tumbled to past 155 per dollar, hitting the lowest level since June 1990.

Tesla Inc. posted lower-than-expected results last quarter, but shares rose 10%. Investors reacted to the automaker’s pledge to produce more affordable models to broaden the market.

The S&P 500 fell 0.4% by midday trading in New York; the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 managed to hold steady; and small caps saw wider declines, with the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE:IWM) down 1%.

Gold remains unchanged, while oil prices edged up by 0.5%, despite the Energy Information Administration revealing a 6.368 million barrel drop in crude oil inventories last week, significantly below market expectations of a 1.6 million barrel increase.

Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) fell 2.7% to $64,500 amid waning sentiment towards riskier assets.

What Happened: The S&P Global’s Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for April indicated a significant deceleration in private sector growth—the slowest in four months—also highlighting reduced inflationary pressures from wages and services.

(NYSE:V), Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Meta PlatformsInc. (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corp. (NYSE:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)(NASDAQ:GOOG).

Easing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East bolstered market sentiment but exerted downward pressure on key global commodities.

Oil prices were broadly steady, erasing early session losses, with the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) light crude trading at $82 a barrel.

Treasury yields saw no movements, amid lack of rate-sensitive data.

The S&P 500’s descent below the 5,000 mark marks a two-month low, bringing the index’s worst monthly performance since December 2022 into sharp focus.

After closing in the red for the last six sessions, the index — tracked by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) — is currently facing its worst losing streak since September 2022.

Furthermore, prices have slipped below the 50-day moving average, a bearish signal that may foretell further downturns.

As the market closed last Friday, the S&P 500’s drawdown was recorded at -5.5% from its most recent peak, though it remains up year-to-date and above its 2021 high.

Where does the current support lie? How much lower could the S&P 500 potentially fall?

S&P 500 Technical Analysis: Experts Eye 4,800 Levels

“Taking it into historical context, it's only registering as noise at the moment,” observedCallum Thomas, head of research and founder at Topdown Charts.

Given the past bearish breadth divergence, the recent fall below the 50-day moving average, and the breach of the 5,000-point support level, there’s a considerable chance the index could retest the 4,800 level, according to Thomas.

Also renewed veteran investor Ed Yardeni expected that a pullback up to 4,800 could be on the table at this juncture.

“It might reach around 4800, which would match the peak just before the previous bear market and put the index unchanged for the year so far,” he said in a recent note.

Further declines could see it approach the 200-day moving average, around 4,700, which would equate to a 10.6% correction from its all-time high, Yardeni added.

This week could extend the sell-off trend, but an unexpected drop in the March Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) inflation rate this Friday might pivot the market towards a robust rally.

S&P 500 Drawdowns Are Healthy, History Tells

Historically, market downturns are not uncommon, and for long-term investors, they present no grave threat.

Fred Alger Management, LLC, recently highlighted that “since 1990, the average drawdown in the S&P 500 has been 14% per calendar year, with drawdowns of at least 10% occurring in 19 of the past 34 years.”

Over the past half-century measured in trading days, the S&P 500 has spent nearly half (44%) of the time in correction territory, having fallen 10% or more from its previous high.

Despite these drawdowns, the index has still returned over 11% annually during this period, turning a hypothetical $10,000 investment into over $2 million. This supports the adage that “it's time in the market, not timing the market,” that counts.

Stocks surged higher on Thursday, with the S&P 500 index aiming to snap a four-day losing streak as investors assess the latest wave of corporate earnings.

During midday trading in New York, all major indices were in the green. Notably, small caps, as tracked by the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE:IWM), outperformed, posting a 1% increase.

Industry-wise, airline stocks continued their upward momentum, with the U.S. Global Jets ETF (NYSE:JETS) climbing 2.7%, building on Wednesday’s 3.9% surge.

Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) had another lackluster session, declining over 3% and on track for its lowest close since January 2023. This decline followed Deutsche Bank’s downgrade of the EV-maker from Buy to Hold, citing concerns over the strategic pivot to autonomous vehicles.

On the data front, the Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Index posted a sharp upside surprise, registering at 15.5 compared to the expected 1.5 for April. However, existing home sales disappointed expectations, declining 4.3% year over year.

Commodities experienced a rebound, with copper witnessing strong gains, up over 2% to reach a 22-month high, and gold showing further strength with a 1% increase. Natural gas prices rallied over 3% due to slower than expected inventory builds last week.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) rallied 4% to reach $63,700 ahead of the highly anticipated halving event.

Ninety-six percent, or 480 out of the 500 companies comprising the S&P 500 index, are trading at lower market values compared to Wall Street analysts’ price targets, signaling abundant potential profit opportunities for investors.

Thus far, April has marked the bleakest month for the U.S. stock market since September 2023, with the S&P 500 index, tracked by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), falling by 3.7%.

Across all 11 sectors constituting the index, only the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLE) has managed to evade losses. The Real Estate Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLRE) emerged as the month’s weakest performer, experiencing a 10% downturn.

Higher-than-expected inflation figures have placed downward pressure on stocks, leading to reduced expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts. As of April 18, investors expect fewer than two rate cuts, down from over three anticipated at the beginning of the month.

Simultaneously, mounting geopolitical risks stemming from the ongoing Middle East crisis have amplified market uncertainties.

However, this phase of increased volatility has subdued the once prevalent bullish sentiment that persisted until the end of March, uncovering attractive opportunities for investors who favor buying the dips of undervalued stocks.

Presented herein are the top 5 contrarian stocks within the S&P 500 index exhibiting the most pronounced relative gap between current market prices and median price targets.

5. Carnival Corporation

Carnival Corp. (NYSE:CCL) has experienced a noticeable downturn, dropping by 11.54% this month and 22.03% year-to-date.

Analysts, however, have maintained consistency in their price forecasts. At the beginning of the year, the median target was $20.78, which has since held steady at $22.

This suggests a substantial 52.20% potential upside from the current trading price of $14.46 per share.

4. Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.

Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. (NYSE:BIO) has witnessed an 18.81% decline in price this month and a 13.03% decrease year-to-date.

Despite market fluctuations, the median price target has remained unchanged at $436.70 since the beginning of 2024.

Presently trading at $280.81 per share, this implies that analysts see a potential upside of 55.51% if the stock price converges with the target.

3. Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc.

Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD) has declined 5.27% this month and by a substantial 27.33% year-to-date.

Analysts have downwardly adjusted their price targets for WBD shares, reducing the median level from $16.64 at the beginning of the year to $13 presently.

Story continues

Despite these downward revisions, the current share price of $8.27 still provides some margin of safety to investors, indicating a potential 57.19% upside if it converges with analysts’ targets.

2. Caesars Entertainment Inc.

Caesars Entertainment Inc. (NYSE:CZR) has declined by 11.25% month-to-date and a more substantial 17.19% year-to-date.

However, despite these negative trends, analysts have made minimal adjustments to their price targets for the casino-related company.

With the current trading price at $38.32, the median price target of $62.50 suggests a significant profit potential of 61% if the current price aligns with analysts’ expectations.

1. Globe Life Inc.

Globe Life Inc. (NYSE:GL) faced a tumultuous April, plummeting by a staggering 50% due to a critical report by short seller Fuzzy Panda Research.

Despite this, since hitting its lows on April 11, the shares have rebounded by 66%, though remaining still well below pre-report levels.

Despite a slight reduction in Wall Street analysts’ price targets, down from $136 to $130 in the past month, the current stock price of $64.98 presents an enticing short-squeeze opportunity, suggesting a profit potential of 100% if investors can counter and push back against Fuzzy Panda’s bearish pressure.

Beginner investors usually go for passive investing, with a focus on consistently increasing wealth over the long term with lower fees and reduced risk. In contrast, investors with more experience may have an inclination towards active investing, seeking to profit from short-term shifts in the market. Passive investment plans normally involve investing in a range of stocks, bonds, and other assets to achieve easy diversification. This approach helps in lessening the impact of market volatility as the investment is spread across different assets. Passive funds, like low-cost ETFs or passively managed mutual funds, offer affordable investment choices with lower management fees and less trading activity. It is also relatively easier to maintain them as they do not require as much ongoing research as active funds do. On the other hand, active investing allows portfolio managers to select investments based on their own judgment rather than following a specific index or predetermined portfolio. This flexibility allows them to respond to real-time market conditions and potentially surpass short-term market benchmarks. Active investing often involves active trading strategies like short-selling and hedging to maximize short-term price movements. However, active fund managers generally charge higher fees due to the higher frequency of trading and specific expertise required for this strategy.

In 2023, global passive equity funds became more popular than active funds for the first time. This shift was driven by investors seeking lower-cost options that follow broad market indices. Passive equity funds reached $15.1 trillion in net assets by December, surpassing the $14.3 trillion held by active funds. This trend towards passive funds began after the 2008 financial crisis as investors sought safer investments during uncertain times, as reported by Reuters. In 2023, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) attracted the most inflows, bringing in $52.83 billion. The iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:IVV) and Fidelity 500 Index (NASDAQ:FXAIX) followed closely, attracting $38.1 billion and $24.79 billion, respectively. Geoffrey Strotman, senior vice president at Segal Marco Advisors, believes that the increasing popularity of passive funds could lead to pricing discrepancies. This could create opportunities for active managers to buy stocks at lower prices and sell them at higher prices. Mark Haefele, chief investment officer of wealth management at UBS AG, predicts a comeback for active funds in 2024. He expects Federal Reserve rate cuts to lower borrowing costs, benefiting small-cap companies more than larger ones.

BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) suggests that investors consider using actively managed strategies more often. They believe that with higher interest rates, ongoing inflation, and increased geopolitical risks, active managers and hedge funds have better chances to outperform simple buy-and-hold portfolios. In the decade leading up to the Covid-19 pandemic, stocks and bonds in developed markets exceeded cash by about 10 and 2 percentage points, respectively, according to BlackRock analysts. Despite this, many investors have been moving away from actively managed funds, with over half of mutual fund and ETF assets in passive products since late last year. At the end of last year, BlackRock managed about $10 trillion in client assets, with $2.6 trillion in active equity, bond, and other strategies, and $6.6 trillion in index and ETF assets. The analysts at BlackRock point out that switching between indexes is a type of active management, enabling investors “to exploit their skill in timing markets and their ability to consistently pick exposure to the right sectors, regions and styles.”

In this article, we discuss the best low cost ETFs, which offer investors exposure to stocks like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA).

Best Low Cost ETFs

15. Amplify Cash Flow Dividend Leaders ETF (NASDAQ:COWS)

5-Year Share Price Performance as of April 15: 15.60%

The Amplify Cash Flow Dividend Leaders ETF (NASDAQ:COWS) ranks 15th on our list of the best low cost ETFs. It focuses on investing in companies with a combination of high trailing and future free cash flow yields, which also have a track record of increasing dividends. The fund seeks to mirror the performance of the Kelly US Cash Flow Dividend Leaders Index. Launched on September 13, 2023, the ETF manages assets amounting to $16.05 million as of April 12, 2024, with a net expense ratio of 0.00%. Its portfolio consists of 55 stocks.

Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust held the largest position in the company, comprising 1.53 million shares valued at $388.15 million.

Artisan Value Fund stated the following regarding FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:

“Other Q4 laggards were global reinsurer Arch Capital and shipping company FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX)—holdings that pulled back following large gains. Back in September 2022, FedEx was selling for less than 8X our estimate of normalized earnings due to substantial pessimism. Although the demand environment remains challenging globally, particularly in the Express segment, the company is delivering solid earnings growth driven by cost savings initiatives. FedEx’s DRIVE program, which seeks to deliver $4 billion in permanent cost reductions by creating an integrated air-ground network similar to that of rival UPS, is showing progress, and workforce reductions have also been enacted. While operating results can be choppy, FedEx’s longer term business economics are highly favorable given the global shipping industry’s consolidated structure and massive barriers to entry that afford operators with pricing power to counter cost inflation and earn respectable returns on capital over the business cycle.”

BRK is a collection of high-quality businesses, excellent management, and a good amount of optionality in their cash position. If the cash were to be deployed accretively, the true value would be greater than an 8% premium (as mentioned above). The combination of a pie that is growing, an increasing share of said pie due to stock buybacks, upside optionality from cash and a tight range of likely business outcomes that span a variety of economic futures gives me comfort in continuing to own Berkshire.

We could wax lyrical about the glaring difference in value between Korean banks priced at 4 times earnings, versus Apple at 28 times, despite diverging fundamentals—Apple is increasingly at risk of bans in China, while Korean banks could double their dividends.

For the first time since early November 2023, less than 30% of S&P 500 stocks are trading above their 50-day moving average — a clear indicator of the current poor market’s breadth.

This significant drop from the 85% observed in late March and 92% at the beginning of January highlights a dramatic reversal in market dynamics.

The 50-day moving average is often seen as a barometer for the short-term health of stocks. Falling below this level en masse suggests that a broad swath of the market is facing downward pressure.

This shift comes amid escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and renewed concerns over inflation, which have collectively nudged traders towards a more guarded stance in April.

On Wednesday, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) closed 0.3% lower, marking its fourth straight session in the red. That’s the longest losing streak since early January.

Chart: Less Than 30% of S&P 500 Stocks Trade Below 50-Day Moving Average

Inflation Concerns

March saw inflation rates rise to 3.5%, overcoming economist expectations and continuing a three-month trend of increases.

“The recent data have clearly not given us greater confidence and instead indicate that it is likely to take longer than expected to achieve that confidence,” Powell said Wednesday.

That sounded like an official delay to rate-cut hopes. With inflation proving stubborn, the outlook for interest rates has shifted significantly.

Futures markets are now anticipating roughly 40 basis points in cuts by the end of the year, or less two quarter-percentage points Fed rate cuts.

S&P 500 Outlook: Heading To A Correction?

Investment analysts are closely watching these market developments.

Veteran investor Ed Yardeni recently predicted a potential retest of the S&P 500's 200-day moving average around the 4700 level, which would represent “a classic 10% correction.”

“The S&P 500 is experiencing its first real bout of volatility this year,” said Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist for LPL Financial.

The index has seen a 3.9% decline in April, which has begun to “create some technical damage.” Notably, the S&P 500 has breached its shorter-term uptrend and fallen below its “20- and 50-day moving average (dma),” positioning the 5,000-point mark as the next critical support level.

Turnquist highlighted that longer-term breadth indicators are more robust, with “nearly 70% of S&P 500 constituents remain above their 200-dma.”

“The lack of major damage to longer-term breadth across the offensive sectors suggests bullish leadership is still on stable ground despite the recent shakeout,” he added.

Story continues

Stephen Suttmeier, technical strategist at Bank of America, highlighted that 12 consecutive months of positive year-over-year returns for the S&P 500 could portend well for the future.

Data suggests that if this trend continues for at least 20 months, the index could see a rise of up to 17.1% (6,150 points) by November 2025.

However, Suttmeier warned of near-term risks. The S&P 500’s struggle to surpass the mid-5,200s, amid typical election year volatility in April and May, points to possible near-term challenges.

Support levels at 5,000, 4,800, and 4,600 will be crucial if the index falters.

The lack of deeply oversold conditions, as indicated by the three-month VIX relative to historical levels and the percentage of stocks above their 50-day moving averages, suggests that the market might need further corrections to establish a more robust low.

There are tons of interesting tidbits about Tax Day.

According to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS):

Officers answered more than one million taxpayer phone calls this season. They processed over 100 million individual tax returns through April 6. Tens of millions more filings will be made on the April 15 deadline. About 19 million taxpayers will file extensions due Oct. 15. More than $200 billion in refunds were already delivered. The average refund was $3,011 — a 4.6% increase from last April's average of $2,878.

These numbers change yearly, but there’s at least one fairly consistent Tax-Day trend: a jittery stock market.

According to Bankrate, citing data from S&P Global’s Kensho unit, the first couple weeks of April are typically “rougher.”

Many taxpayers will liquidate stocks or tap their money market funds to fulfill immediate cash requirements.

And from 2000 to 2016, the S&P 500 Index declined an average 0.2% during the first two weeks before Tax Day.

After Tax Day, it’s a different scenario. The S&P 500 usually bounces back to finish April about 1.7% higher on average (climbing “an astonishing” 75% of the time, Bankrate notes).

Per Money.com, the S&P 500 index enjoyed an average gain of 0.83% in the week following the tax deadline from 1998 to 2022 (for 19 out of 25 years). The one-week median gain throughout the year is 0.31%.

In April, the market’s overall impact is minimal. Investors would be wise to stick to their long-term investment strategy and prioritize contributing to tax-advantaged retirement accounts (i.e., 401k plans and IRAs).

Historically, the S&P 500 has yielded around 10 percent annual gains. The goal is to stay invested over time rather than attempting to time the market.

Financial advisors typically suggest that their clients invest in S&P 500 index funds (see below) and remain focused on distant future outcomes rather than short-term fluctuations.

SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:SPY) iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:IVV) Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:VOO) iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF (NYSE:IVW) Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (NYSE:RSP)

Yardeni Research president Ed Yardeni predicts the S&P 500 could surge 26% by 2026 to 6,500.

""I think this is a long-term bull market,” the economist told CNBC in March. “I still got 5,400 by year-end and that was a pretty bold call a year ago, but right now that's looking pretty conservative, and why not more?""

U.S. states are taking the fight to court.

Late last year, Tennessee sued BlackRock Inc. (NYSE:BLK), alleging the world's largest asset manager made ""inconsistent statements about its investment strategies [that] deprived consumers of the ability to make an informed choice,"" calling the statements ""misleading.""

While BlackRock rejected the claims, saying the company ""fully and accurately [discloses] our investment practices and our approach to proxy voting,"" the backlash has continued.

Mississippi is now seeking a multimillion-dollar penalty against BlackRock aimed at stopping ""fraudulent action"" and claiming BlackRock makes ""untrue and misleading statements"" focused on ""pushing environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors on portfolio companies.""

Trending: This startup coined “eBay for gamers” with a breathtaking track record has opened up a window to invest in its future growth.

Mississippi's action follows Florida, Louisiana and Missouri announcing plans to revoke investment mandates from BlackRock, citing concerns the company is putting ESG over investor returns.

It's not just states arguing against ESG. Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk proclaimed that ""ESG is the devil,"" furious that a tobacco company like Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) had higher ESG scores than Tesla, a pioneer in electric vehicles.

The backlash against BlackRock has impacted its business. CEO Larry Fink disclosed last year that the company lost about $4 billion in assets under management resulting from anger over its ESG policies.

While the broader market tracked by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) has surpassed its prior 2021 high, BlackRock still trades around 14% off its all-time highs.

88,2024-03-18T16:30:14+00:00,Wall Street Analyst Warns Apple Stock Could Get 'Killed' And 'Would Not Be Surprised If Buffett Is Selling Right Now',"It's been a terrible year so far for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) investors, with the company's share price down about 7% year to date, compared to the roughly 9% gain the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:SPY) has experienced during the same period.

Commonly cited reasons for the disappointing start to the year have been fears of lower demand in China, potentially falling behind in the artificial intelligence (AI) race, regulatory pressures and low growth.

Jordan Klein, an analyst at Mizuho, sees another major risk on the horizon, warning that things could get worse for Apple.

Klein said he ""would not be surprised if [Buffett] is selling right now"" and that Buffett ""knows when that 13F comes out showing he started to sell, that [Apple] shares will get killed as retail investors rush for the exit.""

Berkshire Hathaway Inc.'s (NYSE:BRK) most recent 13F disclosed that Buffett sold some of his Apple stock, albeit a marginal 1% of his massive position.

News of Berkshire Hathaway selling more shares could put pressure on the stock given that the company owns 5.9% of all outstanding Apple shares, representing 42.8% of its entire stock portfolio.

While Buffett has said that his ""favorite holding period is forever,"" Berkshire's portfolio has experienced turnover lately.

Trending: This startup coined “eBay for gamers” with a breathtaking track record has opened up a window to invest in its future growth.

In addition to trimming its Apple stock, Berkshire exited its positions in StoneCo Ltd. (NASDAQ:STNE), Markel Group Inc. (NYSE:MKL), Globe Life Inc. (NYSE:GL), and D.R. Horton Inc. (NYSE:DHI) as well as significantly trimming its stakes in HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) and Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA).

Story continues

The D.R Horton stake in particular was built up as recently as the second quarter of last year.

Klein sees the stock as likely to lag the market until the company shares more about its AI plans, which he speculates might come as soon as June at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) developer event.

Dan Ives, a senior equity research analyst at Wedbush Securities, deems the situation a strong buying opportunity, giving Apple's stock a price target of $250 per share. He cites massive pent-up demand in the iPhone upgrade cycle and high expectations of ""AI finally coming to Cupertino (in California).""

For long-term investors in Apple, it's paid to ignore short-term worries and stay the course. In the past five years, the stock has seen a more than 267% gain. Meanwhile, investors fortunate enough to have bought and held since its 1984 initial public offering (IPO) would be sitting on an over 142,000% gain.

The 13Fs are due within 45 days of a quarter ending, so investors waiting for the next updates on Berkshire’s portfolio will likely need to wait until mid-May.

Since the launch of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), ETFs have gained significant prominence in the index investing landscape and beyond. In the US market, ETF assets have surged to $6.5 trillion in assets under management (AUM), growing at an annualized rate of 23.8% since 2000. The number of ETF offerings has also increased to 2,988 funds. According to State Street Global Advisors, nearly three-quarters of surveyed ETF investors believe that ETFs have enhanced the overall performance of their portfolios, and more than two-thirds think ETFs have improved their investing skills. ETF trading volumes illustrate their role as a primary liquidity vehicle in the secondary market, representing 32% of trading volume on US exchanges in 2022—a figure that has steadily increased over the past four years.

As a reminder, Novo Nordisk is a global pharmaceutical company based in Denmark and has long been the leader in developing insulin for diabetes patients. In recent years, the company’s innovation into GLP-1 drugs has been shown not only to help diabetics control blood sugar levels but also to have significant efficacy in weight loss. Obesity has become a global epidemic, creating materially negative knock-on effects for humans that range from an increase in cardiovascular events and, thus, higher mortality to a lower general quality of life. We believe that, over time, payors will recognize the value of these obesity treatments to both patients and the overall healthcare system.”

BRK is a collection of high-quality businesses, excellent management, and a good amount of optionality in their cash position. If the cash were to be deployed accretively, the true value would be greater than an 8% premium (as mentioned above). The combination of a pie that is growing, an increasing share of said pie due to stock buybacks, upside optionality from cash and a tight range of likely business outcomes that span a variety of economic futures gives me comfort in continuing to own Berkshire.”

7. Vanguard Health Care Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSE:VHT)

5-year Share Price Performance as of March 11: 53.46%

Vanguard Health Care Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSE:VHT) aims to replicate the performance of Spliced U.S. Investable Market Health Care 25/50 Index1, which is a benchmark index measuring the investment return of healthcare stocks.

Eli Lilly has a deep pipeline in treatment areas focused on metabolic disorders, oncology, immunology and central nervous system disorders. Currently, there are two phase three assets, Orforglipron, an oral GLP-1 and retatrutide, a triple incretin agonist, which have the potential to expand upon the potential success of Mounjaro. We believe that Mounjaro has the potential to commercialize beyond type 2 diabetes and obesity, potentially in the areas mentioned above of heart disease, sleep apnea, fatty liver disease and chronic kidney disease. We believe the premium valuation is supported by this outsized growth profile.”

6. Vanguard Mid-Cap Growth Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSE:VOT)

Giverny Capital Asset Management stated the following regarding Arista Networks, Inc. (NYSE:ANET) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:

“We did a bit of portfolio sculpting during the year, with mixed results. We trimmed Arista Networks, Inc. (NYSE:ANET) several times during the year as it soared. Those trims, a very small one in March at roughly $163 and a larger one in August at $183, don’t look smart with Arista finishing the year at $235 (and up more in January). Arista rose 94% this year. The good news is, Arista finished the year as our second largest holding, at 7.9% of the portfolio.

If you are wondering how I could sell some Arista at $163 but then hold most of it at $235, the answer is that Arista’s outstanding competitive position in Artificial Intelligence became clearer to me as the year progressed. I felt in March that Arista would earn $8 per share in a few years. I see today that it might earn $8 in 2025.

It’s possible there is AI-related froth in the Arista stock price, but also probable that Arista will continue to grow rapidly as the computing centers that process AI queries require enormous amounts of data bandwidth. I believe Arista’s routers and switches are the best tools for routing so-called hyperscale traffic. Also, its operating software allows computer giants to manage the kudzu-like growth of their data centers, lowering their total cost of operation.

The sales of both Arista and Heico reflected my desire to manage PE multiple risk. I keep learning the hard way, however, that trimming your winners generally doesn’t add value. If the valuation is beyond justification, sell the position. If the valuation is high but the business continues to dominate its niche, grow steadily and add value for customers, maybe just take a walk around the block until the urge to sell goes away.”

90,2024-03-08T23:00:19+00:00,Michael Saylor: Bitcoin Can Compete With S&amp;P 500 ETFs,"At the Bitcoin Atlantis conference in Madeira, Portugal, MicroStrategy Inc. Chairman Michael Saylor discussed Bitcoin and other topics with podcast host Natalie Brunell. One of the points of conversation surrounded the recently approved spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds ETFs and their ability to compete with other top asset classes and ETFs.

""We thought that maybe Bitcoin was a competitor to gold, but it has actually run up the leaderboard, and now it's starting to nip at the heels of the S&P 500 Index ETFs,"" Saylor said.

Don't Miss:

If you invested $100 in DOGE when Elon Musk first tweeted about it in 2019, here’s how much you’d have today. About 22% of the adult population in the U.S. own a share of Bitcoin, how much would $10 get you today?

Bitcoin and gold are viewed somewhat similarly by some investors, as they have a limited supply and can be seen as a hedge against inflation. However, gold has been around for millennia, while Bitcoin is barely 15 years old. Bitcoin has quickly risen the ranks and Saylor no longer sees gold as the main competitor to Bitcoin from an investment perspective.

Instead, Saylor believes that Bitcoin has the potential to compete with the largest ETFs in the world, namely the S&P 500 index ETFs, such as SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) and iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:IVV).

In terms of market cap, the S&P 500 is leaps and bounds ahead of Bitcoin. It has a market cap of over $40 trillion, well above Bitcoin's $1.3 trillion. However, Bitcoin's recent performance, according to Saylor, could be a sign that Bitcoin is ready to compete with some of the largest funds in the world.

The spot Bitcoin ETFs were launched less than two months ago but have already surpassed more than $50 billion in combined total assets, according to Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. The ETFs also saw a record amount of inflows during their first 30 days.

Story continues

""These ETFs opened up an entire financial world of awareness, opportunity and functionality to the 99% of mainstream investors. You really can't underestimate just how profoundly important that is to the entire network,"" Saylor noted.

Saylor and Microstrategy are the largest institutional holders of Bitcoin, amassing a stash of 193,000 Bitcoins over the past several years. The investment as a whole is up more than 100% and is currently worth over $13.5 billion.

Despite the hugely successful investment, Saylor does not see the company selling any time soon. When asked about a potential exit strategy, Saylor said, ""Bitcoin is the exit strategy.""

Not only does Saylor not see an exit in the near future, but he is also taking on debt to buy more Bitcoin. MicroStrategy recently sold $700 million of convertible senior notes to buy even more Bitcoin.

As Bitcoin and spot ETFs continue to perform well and see more investment, it will be interesting to see how it plays out. Will Bitcoin ETFs catch up to the S&P 500 ETFs? Only time will tell.

91,2024-02-27T17:07:55+00:00,"Apollo's Chief Economist Sounds Alarm On AI Bubble, Warning It's 'Bigger Than The 1990s Tech Bubble'","Count Torsten Sløk, chief economist at Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) as a skeptic of the artificial intelligence (AI) hype behind much of the recent stock market rally.

In a note published over the weekend titled ""The Current AI Bubble is Bigger than the 1990s Tech Bubble,"" Sløk writes that the top 10 companies in the S&P 500 today have a higher forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio than the top 10 companies had in the mid-1990s during the tech bubble.

Don't Miss:

Harvard-founded AI startup is solving paywalls, growing 5x yearly and looking for new shareholders. This startup in the climate tech industry could unlock the riches flowing 30 feet above your head.

A forward price-to-earnings ratio is a valuation metric that divides the current share price by the estimated next year's earnings per share. A lower ratio means that a stock is cheaper, all else being equal.

The median forward P/E ratio of the top 10 companies in the S&P today is around 40, while in 2000, at the peak of the tech bubble, the same metric was relatively much lower at only about 25.

It's not the first time Apollo Global's leading economist flagged valuation concerns among the market's largest companies.

In a note published on Jan. 9, Apollo pointed out that the market cap of the Magnificent Seven equaled the size of the Japanese, Canadian and U.K. markets combined.

Just because a company has a high forward price-to-earnings ratio does not mean it will live up to its growth expectations. It's just that investors are leaving less margin of safety for any possible growth disappointments.

Extra risk market concentration brings more risk if one or more of these high flyers cannot live up to its growth targets.

The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) tracks the S&P 500 index, a market cap-weighted index of large- and mid-cap U.S. stocks.

Story continues

The top 10 holdings of the SPDR ETF account for over 31% of its total assets, leaving passive index investors potentially more exposed to concentration risk than they might realize.

Whether or not the AI bubble bursts or lives up to its high expectations is a question investors will have to tackle in the years to come. However, for those skeptical of valuations or market concentration, it might pay to remember the lessons from economist John Maynard Keynes, who shared that markets can stay irrational for longer than an investor can stay solvent.

Investors who have ridden the AI wave up have been rewarded. The S&P 500, led by its big tech components, is already up over 7% year to date. Meanwhile, small-cap exchange-traded funds (ETFs) without the major AI players, such as the Vanguard Small-Cap Index Fund ETF (NYSE:VB), have lagged, gaining just over 2% year to date.

Perhaps Soros's most famous bet came against the pound in 1992 when it netted his fund about $1 billion in one trade, considered by some to be the greatest currency trade of all time.

However, Soros didn't start the Quantum Fund alone. Instead, he founded it alongside another now-famous investor, Jim Rogers.

Even with his bearish conviction, he points out that he's ""not shorting yet because often at the end there’s a blowoff and things get really crazy.""

Investors who don't want the stress of storing the actual physical metal in their possession could consider an exchange-traded fund (ETF) such as the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) or the iShares Silver Trust (NYSE:SLV).

Story continues

It should be noted, however, that Rogers has not been accurate with his predictions in recent years.

In 2011, he shared that there was a 100% chance of a crisis worse than in 2008. If investors heeded his advice then and never got back into a market-tracking index fund such as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) they would have missed out on about 290% returns. Of course, these impressive returns came despite there being wars, a pandemic, flash crashes and inflation scares.

However, to completely dismiss the advice of one of the world's most legendary investors might not end up looking wise if Rogers is right about a serious crash being around the corner — especially if it is the worst in his lifetime, given how much he's seen in his 81 years.

93,2024-02-16T17:56:19+00:00,Citadel Is The Most Successful Hedge Fund In History: Here Are Its Top Investment Picks,"Citadel LLC is one of the largest hedge funds based in the U.S., with approximately $92.46 billion in total assets under management as of Sept. 30, 2023. Citadel has generated roughly $74 billion in total gains since its inception in 1990, making it the most successful hedge fund of all time.

Founded by Ken Griffin, Citadel was the second best-performing fund in 2023, raking in approximately $8.1 billion in profits last year. Griffin, who serves as the CEO and co-chief investment officer for Citadel, is currently the 37th richest man in the world, with a total net worth of nearly $37 billion. Let's look at some of Citadel's largest holdings.

Microsoft and Activision Blizzard

As of Sept. 30, 2024, Citadel owned approximately 5.04 million shares of Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) and 15.02 million shares of Activision Blizzard, accounting for roughly 1.72% and 1.52% of the total portfolio, respectively. Citadel bought its stake in Activision Blizzard for a median price of $87.06 per share

Microsoft completed its acquisition of Activision Blizzard for $95 per share, or $69 billion later in October last year. Following the acquisition, Citadel is estimated to have made a profit of over $119 million.

Shares of MSFT surged over 56% in fiscal 2023, making it one of the best-performing stocks in Citadel's portfolio. With a market cap of approximately $3.12 trillion, Microsoft is currently the most valuable in the world.

The company's extensive investments in AI over the past few years have been paying off, as its minority stake in ChatGPT maker OpenAI is expected to generate billions.

In the fiscal 2024 second quarter, which ended Dec. 31, 2023, Microsoft's total revenues rose 18% year-over-year to $62 billion, while EPS increased 33% from the same period last year to $2.93.

“We've moved from talking about AI to applying AI at scale,” Satya Nadella, CEO and Chairman of Microsoft, said in the latest earnings release, “By infusing AI across every layer of our tech stack, we're winning new customers and helping drive new benefits and productivity gains across every sector.""

Boston Scientific Corporation

Citadel holds approximately 21.16 million shares of Boston Scientific Corp. (NYSE:BSX) as of Sept. 30, 2023, translating to 1.21% weightage in its total portfolio. The hedge fund bought shares of BSX at an average price of $47.63.

Shares of BSX have risen by over 13% so far this year, outperforming the benchmark S&P 500 index's 5.2% returns over this period.

The company announced its plans to acquire Axonics Inc. for $3.7 billion, or $71 per share, last month, which is expected to boost the former's urology business. Axonics was ranked #2 on the Financial Times list of fastest-growing companies in 2023. This acquisition is expected to boost Boston Scientific's growth rate significantly in the near term.

Analysts expect BSX's revenues to increase 9.4% year-over-year to $15.58 billion in fiscal 2024. The company's EPS is expected to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12% over the next five years.

Mizuho upgraded its rating on BSX to Buy on Feb 1, with a price target of $80, indicating a potential upside of over 22%. Investment bank Raymond James has a Strong Buy rating on the medical device manufacturer, with a price target of $73, reflecting a potential upside of nearly 12%.

SPDR S&P 500 ETF

Roughly 1.12% of Citadel's total assets under management is invested in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY). Investment gurus have long preached the importance and benefits of investing in a low-cost, passively managed index ETF, which aims to replicate the performance of a benchmark index.

""Consistently buy an S&P 500 low-cost index fund,"" Warren Buffett said, ""Keep buying it through thick and thin and especially through thin.""

The S&P 500 index hit an all-time high, crossing the 5,000 mark on Feb 8. Year-to-date, the index has surged by over 5% despite stalled rate cuts and persistent macroeconomic headwinds.

UBS Global Research predicts the benchmark index to cross 5,150 in 2024. As the Federal Reserve gears up to slash the federal funds rate in the second half of the year, the equity rally is expected to continue through the upcoming months.

Latest data shows that more and more Americans are investing in stocks, a trend that started during the COVID-19 pandemic days. In December, a Wall Street Journal report cited data from the Federal Reserve's survey of consumer finances which said that about 58% of U.S. households owned stocks in 2022, up from 53% in 2019. This was the highest household stock-ownership rate recorded in the survey that is conducted after every three years. This data shows that the rise of individual investors seen after the pandemic was not a temporary trend. As millions of Americans received stimulus checks during the pandemic days, they turned to retail investing platforms like Robinhood and other investing apps to pile into stocks. That trend is still going on despite the massive decline in stocks seen in 2022 following the inflation storm and rate hikes.

Methodology

For this article, we used Robinhood Investor Index (which shows the most popular stocks on the investing platform Robinhood), some research reports and screeners highlighting the most popular stocks among individual investors to find out 16 most widely held stocks among individual investors. Some top names in the list include Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META). Most Widely Held Stocks by Individuals

""The magnificent seven, that underpin the S&P 500 performance, which includes Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), now comprise almost 30% of the market capitalization of the S&P500. At least three of the seven stocks have heightened downside risk and suffer from already high penetration, weakening end markets, competitive risk, and lofty valuation. They have been remarkably resilient to increased interest rates and the potential for slowing growth. Small and midcap stocks, on the other hand, have been systemically penalized by fears of recession and continue to price that eventuality even as significantly better outcomes have become more probable. Today, it's relatively easy to find attractive investments in this segment.""

9. SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 82

8. Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 89

According to Robinhood index tracker, Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) is one of the most popular stocks on the Robinhood platform.

Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) has been seeing a lot of activity in the hedge fund space as it prepares to enter a battle with Nelson Peltz of Trian Partners. Peltz is seeking two board seats at Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS).

Activist hedge fund Blackwells Capital will nominate three directors to Walt Disney Co’s (NYSE:DIS) board in support of Disney CEO Bob Iger.

Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) and ValueAct Capital Management recently entered an agreement according to which Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) will provide information to the investment firm and consult with ValueAct on strategic matters, including through meetings with the Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) Board and management.

Madison Sustainable Equity Fund made the following comment about The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

""During the quarter, we sold our positions in Bristol-Myers Squibb and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS).  The Walt Disney Company is facing a difficult and uncertain transition in its core media business assets including the ESPN business and other linear media assets. These media assets are cash generative but face secular decline as consumers are cutting their expensive cable subscriptions and moving to alternative streaming options. This has resulted in a decline in operating profits for the media division. The media business has long-term fixed costs related to its sports broadcasting agreement with multiple sports leagues which will further pressure profits during this transition.""

7. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 110

Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has made a comeback against NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) by launching new chips for AI and the company plans to continue to up its AI game.

Wells Fargo analysts led by Aaron Rakers earlier this month said in a note that they like Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) at the current levels as they believe the semiconductor industry is set for a rebound.

Artisan Global Opportunities Fund made the following comment about Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:

""Among our top contributors were Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), NU Holdings and Netflix. AMD's data center CPUs are used in the cloud service provider (CSP) servers. In addition to the broader secular tailwind from cloud adoption, the company has a performance and pricing advantage over Intel, which we believe will enable it to continue capturing market share. However, the recent stock price rally was due to growing excitement around the company's AI exposure. It will launch its new MI300 graphics processing unit (GPU) chip later this year to compete against the dominant market leader NVIDIA. Similar to its approach that won market share from Intel within the CPU market, AMD's product will aim to provide similar performance at a more attractive price. AMD is already working with Microsoft and Meta, while Amazon publicly stated that it is evaluating AMD's inferencing chips. Using assumptions around the total GPU market size, potential market share gains and price points, our research indicates this could be a $20 billion opportunity for AMD. That would nearly double its revenue. While the company has not historically missed many deadlines, there is execution risk as it works to manufacture and distribute these complex chips at scale, which, combined with an elevated valuation after the stock's strong performance run, led us to trim the position.""

6. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 180

NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) has seen a huge rise in popularity among retail and institutional investors amid the AI boom. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares have gained about 234% over the past one year, with many analysts repeatedly saying there’s a lot more room to run for the stock because of a burgeoning demand for AI chips.

In addition to Nvidia, hedge funds and retail investors are piling into Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META).

In its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter, ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA):

""Much of that differential can be attributed to the performance of the Magnificent Seven (Alphabet, Amazon.com, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla), a basket of mega cap growth stocks that accounted for 47.8% of the benchmark return for the quarter and 65.4% for 2023.

The ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy maintains exposure to six of the seven stocks, with overweights in Amazon.com, Meta and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Those three stocks, as well as Microsoft, were among the leading contributors to Strategy performance for the quarter. Microsoft and Nvidia continued to be supported by strong execution and leadership positions in the implementation of generative artificial intelligence (AI).

These are high-quality, cash flow generative businesses that we will continue to own, actively adjusting our positioning sizes based on risk/reward and portfolio construction priorities. With Nvidia shares more than tripling in 2023, we opportunistically took profits throughout the year, an approach that continued in the fourth quarter with additional trims that brought the position down to 6% of overall assets.

Active management of our mega cap exposure contributed to the Strategy outperforming the benchmark both in the fourth quarter and through the narrow leadership market of 2023. We also attribute these improved results to solid stock picking, being opportunistic in adding to or initiating new positions in growth companies at or near the bottom of their earnings cycle, and maintaining a commitment to diversification across our three buckets of growth: select, stable and cyclical.""

95,2024-01-08T21:40:36+00:00,3 Dynamic Dividend Stocks In Warren Buffett’s ‘Secret’ Portfolio,"Few would argue Warren Buffett doesn’t have a golden touch when it comes to investing. He has racked up over 4 million percent returns at Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A)(NYSE:BRK-B) since taking over as chairman in 1965. The annualized 20% returns are double that of the S&P 500 over the same time frame. It’s why investors pore over every 13F filing the company files with the SEC hoping to gain insights from Warren Buffett stock buys and sells.

What is not so well known is Berkshire Hathaway isn’t his only stock playground. In 1998 he bought General Re. Just a few years prior, however, the reinsurer itself acquired specialty investment company New England Asset Management (NEAM). Today it is a subsidiary of Berkshire with $610 million in assets under management.

With its own stock portfolio, NEAM is essentially a secret garden of hidden investment treasures that are part of Berkshire Hathaway. The largest holding is the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), which accounts for over 14% of the total. What follows are three top-yielding Warren Buffett dividend stocks hiding in NEAM that are also great buys for you in 2024.

Ares Capital (NASDAQ:ARCC) is the largest publicly traded business development company (BDC) in the U.S. With a market capitalization of over $11.6 billion, it invests in middle-market companies often neglected by big bank lenders. Ares focuses on generating high-quality income from its investments, as well as capital appreciation by taking equity stakes in the businesses. Worth almost $22 billion, its diversified portfolio contains some 490 companies across various industries and geographies.

The BDC has an enviable track record of delivering strong financial performance for its investors. Since its IPO in 2004, Ares generated a total return of over 900%, almost double the performance of the S&P 500. It is well-positioned to benefit from an economic recovery and the rising demand for customized financing solutions. Its high use of leverage, however, could impact performance during a recession. It could exacerbate losses.

Story continues

The high-interest rate environment we’re in explains why the stock is up only 8% over the past year, but that’s not the whole picture. Ares dividend yields 9.4% which increased its total return to over 20% last year. And much of Ares portfolio investments are through floating interest rates. Such investments historically perform quite well, even in recessions. About 84% of its new investments are floating rate loans.

Ares Capital has ample liquidity and access to low-cost funding sources to support its growth strategy. The BDC should be on an investor’s watch list at the least if not a part of their portfolio.

AT&T (T) Image of AT&T (T stock) logo on a gray storefront.

AT&T (NYSE:T) is something of a contrarian pick amongst NEAM’s dynamic dividend stocks. The telecom slashed its dividend in half in 2022 when it spun off its WarnerMedia division. Yet Ma Bell used the proceeds to pay down some of its significant debt load and though lower, the dividend yields a healthy 6.4%. In fact, the dividend is more sustainable now without the drag of the entertainment business.

It took some time for AT&T’s stock to recover but as the national 5G infrastructure rollout continues look for the telecom to excel. The new standard means download speeds will increase for the first time in a decade, which will encourage even greater customer usage. Data consumption is one of the most profitable portions of AT&T’s business.

Higher speeds will also encourage more customers to use its broadband services. In September AT&T surpassed 20.7 million fiber customers. It’s on track to meet its goal of 30 million fiber customers by 2025. It anticipates adding 1 million such customers for all of 2023 marking the sixth consecutive year it has done so.

It’s no longer a growth stock but is still a reliable income generator. This is why dividend investors continue buying shares.

Kinder Morgan (KMI) Kinder Morgan logo on a sign outside the company headquarters in Houston.

One of the strongest arguments in favor of Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) is it is the largest natural gas pipeline operator in North America, with a network of 82,000 miles of pipelines. It also owns and operates 140 terminals, 700 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of storage capacity, and 5.4 Bcf of renewable natural gas generation capacity. This gives it a competitive advantage and exposure to the growing demand for natural gas, which is a cleaner and cheaper alternative to coal and oil.

Kinder Morgan faces limited commodity price fluctuation exposure because it operates on long-term, fixed-fee contracts. It gets paid by simply making the transportation and storage capacity available. It doesn’t matter if the customer takes the product or not. That positions it to benefit from the growing demand for natural gas. Also, the need for more pipeline infrastructure will fuel further expansion.

Kinder Morgan stock was flat over the past year but rose 12% in the last quarter. That helped lift its dividend yield to 6.3%, which is well above the S&P 500’s 1.5% yield. Kinder Morgan has a strong balance sheet. Its dividend is well supported and management supplements it with a stock buyback program. It’s no wonder why the oil and gas stock is part of NEAM’s portfolio.

96,2024-01-05T16:47:15+00:00,Bargain Hunting: Time to Buy the 3 Worst-Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks?,"It was terrific last year for the S&P 500, but looking at some of the worst-performing S&P 500 stocks is still worth it. The benchmark index jumped 24% and hit a new all-time high. That’s the textbook definition of a bull market. But we need some asterisks. It wasn’t a broad-based run higher. The popular index was carried by just a handful of stocks, the Magnificent 7. Remove them from the equation and the S&P was up only a couple of percentage points.

That’s why simply buying an index fund is the best investment decision for many investors. Because the competing forces of fear and greed rule us, we either buy stocks too late or sell them too soon. Trying to time the market is a fool’s errand. It’s why even Warren Buffett owns the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) and the Vanguard 500 Index Fund ETF (NYSE:VOO).

Of course, Buffett is a stock picker. He doesn’t passively manage Berkshire Hathaway‘s (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) portfolio. If all he did was buy an index there would be no reason for you to buy Berkshire stock. Instead he looks for good business trading at a discount to its intrinsic value.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Some of the biggest discounts today can be found in the worst-performing S&P 500 stocks. Just because they tanked in 2023 doesn’t make them a buy, though. We need to look more closely at their business to see if the discount is worth it. What follows are the three deepest bottom dwellers on the index. Let’s see whether we should add them to our portfolios.

Worst-Performing S&P 500 Stocks: Dollar General (DG) Dollar General (DG) store front with yellow store sign, midday

Deep discount dollar store operator Dollar General (NYSE:DG) lost 45% of its value in 2023. For a company that sells most of its products for $10 or less, it’s hard to imagine it doing so poorly. Yet even its cheap goods weren’t resonating with customers. And that was just the problem.

Story continues

Consumers flush with stimulus cash purchased discretionary items en masse during the pandemic. Dollar General stocked up on such goods and failed to read the signs over the past few years that sentiment changed. As inflation soared and interest rates roared higher, shoppers became more choosy with their wallets. They began buying more basic goods and everyday needs. The dollar store chain, however, was still flush with discretionary items, and consumers shopped elsewhere.

Fortunately, management realized the problem and is correcting course. It is stocking more consumable goods on its shelves, which creates more return trips to replenish them. Sales are rising, but it’s not a quick U-turn to make. Comparable store sales are still down. Yet, with a new management team in place and the problem identified, Dollar General seems a good bet to rebound in 2024.

FMC (FMC) FMC logo on the website homepage FMC stock

It was a long trip lower across the entire year for FMC (NYSE:FMC), which lost half its value last year. The global destocking trend of insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides hurt the agricultural stock. It was far more severe than the company anticipated, though the situation is improving. FMC’s financials will still look ugly, and management expects full-year revenue to be down over 20% from last year. It expects profits will also be halved.

CEO Mark Douglas told analysts, “The crop protection market is working through the most severe channel destock ever on record.” Although FMC’s stock is moving higher again, rising 25% off its low point, don’t expect a quick reversal to occur. Douglas is looking to 2026 as the time when it should be past this 100-year flood event.

Yet that could make now a perfect time to buy FMC stock. Purchasing cyclical stocks during their downturn ensures you remain invested when the inflection point hits. And the stock looks cheap. It trades at the same level it did 10 years ago, and at 1.5x sales, it is well below FMC’s historical averages.

FMC’s portfolio of agricultural products is essential to farming and still needed. Look for FMC to recover. It might not be in 2024, but certainly beyond.

The biggest loser in the S&P 500 was Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH). The largest manufacturer of residential solar inverters lost 54% of its value in 2023 as the solar market slumped. Inflation and the rapid rise in interest rates put new solar installations out of reach for many consumers.

There are only two major manufacturers of inverters, Enphase and SolarEdge Technologies (NASDAQ:SEDG). Enphase has a 50% market share, while SolarEdge commands a 40% share. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is a distant third at 5%. Inverters convert the direct current (DC) produced by solar panels into the alternating current (AC) used in homes.

The solar industry is cyclical and is trending lower now. Analysts forecast that after growing 31% in 2021 and 40% in 2022, the solar market will only rise 9% in 2023 and contract this year.

The one hope for Enphase and the solar industry is that the Federal Reserve halted its aggressive interest rate policy. It might even cut rates again in 2024. If the cost of a system installation drops significantly, it might spur new demand. There is not much clarity in the outlook, so a rebound by Enphase Energy this year looks doubtful.

As 2023 draws to a close, the oft-predicted recession is still nowhere in sight and the S&P 500 index is flirting with a new all-time high. It was a strong year for ocean shipping stocks: They performed even better than the broader market.

FreightWaves ranked 2023 shipping stock performance based on the change in the adjusted closing price (adjusted for dividends) on Wednesday versus the adjusted closing price on Dec. 30, 2022.

To put results in context, U.S.-listed shipping stock performance was compared to the SPDR exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the S&P 500 index (NYSE: SPY).

The final tally shows some surprises at the top.

Top 5 shipping stock gains of 2023

No. 1 — Dorian LPG (NYSE: LPG). The winner, by a long shot, is Connecticut-based Dorian LPG. Its adjusted share price surged 184% this year. That’s more than seven times the gain of the S&P 500 ETF.

No one would have predicted Dorian taking the crown at the beginning of 2023. Dorian transports liquefied petroleum gas — propane and butane —  in very large gas carriers (VLGCs). Sentiment on the VLGC sector was weak as this year began, given the high number of newbuildings due for delivery.

Strong demand ultimately trumped market headwinds from newbuildings. Panama Canal disruptions lengthened VLGC voyages, giving further support to spot rates. On Dec. 22, Dorian’s share price hit its highest level since the company went public in 2014. (Chart: FreightWaves based on adjusted closing price data from Yahoo Finance)

No. 2 — Frontline (NYSE: FRO). Shares of tanker giant Frontline doubled this year, rising 97%.

The company, founded by shipping tycoon John Fredriksen, is currently taking delivery of 24 very large crude carriers (VLCCs; tankers that carry 2 million barrels of oil) purchased from Euronav (NYSE: EURN) for $2.35 billion.

As a result of this transaction, which will boost fleet capacity by 58%, Frontline “will completely dwarf all publicly listed tanker competition,” said Pareto Securities analyst Eirik Haavaldsen in October.

Story continues

No. 3 — Overseas Shipholding Group (NYSE: OSG). OSG spun off its foreign-flag tankers into International Seaways (NYSE: INSW) after emerging from bankruptcy in 2014, leaving OSG with its Jones Act tankers and barges. (Jones Act vessels serve legally protected U.S. coastwise trades.)

OSG is not a high-profile name in shipping equity circles. It has a small market cap ($383 million, compared to Frontline’s $4.46 billion) and limited analyst coverage. Yet its shares quietly rose 90% this year, more than any other U.S.-listed crude or products tanker company save Frontline.

No. 4 — Euroseas (NASDAQ: ESEA). Founded by Greece’s Aristides Pittas, Euroseas is a small player that had previously operated a mixed fleet of dry bulk ships and container vessels. Pittas split the fleet in 2018, hiving off the bulkers into Eurodry (NASDAQ: EDRY) and turning Euroseas into a pure-play container-ship lessor.

Lease rates held up surprisingly well this year despite a tidal wave of newbuilding deliveries. Euroseas’ adjusted share price rose 90%.

No. 5 — Matson (NYSE: MATX). Stocks of almost all container shipping lines have been under heavy pressure this year as incremental capacity from newbuilding deliveries outweighs transport demand. The worst performer among larger U.S.-listed shipping names across all vessel segments is Israeli liner company Zim (NYSE: ZIM). Zim’s adjusted share price is down 19% in 2023.

And then there’s Matson, whose share price is up 80%. Matson’s stock hit a new 52-week high on Dec. 22. With the exception of March-April 2022, at the peak of the supply chain crisis, Matson’s share price has never been higher.

“Unicorns do exist — just look at Matson,” said Stifel analyst Ben Nolan in October.

Matson’s market cap of $3.85 billion is more than triple the market cap of Zim, despite the fact that Zim’s fleet capacity is nine times higher. Matson operates in protected Jones Act trades, as well as in the China-West Coast international trade, where it offers expedited service that competes with air cargo.

Restrictions on both the Panama and Suez canal routes are making Matson’s niche China-West Coast service even more attractive.

Tanker stocks

FreightWaves also analyzed 2023 shipping stock performance by vessel sector, calculating average sector performance on a market-cap-weighted basis.

Sentiment on tanker stocks was ebullient at the beginning of 2023. There was even talk of a new “super cycle.” But only a few tanker stocks lived up to those very lofty expectations. Share performance of owners of product tankers — vessels that carry gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and other refined products — has been particularly disappointing.

Beyond Frontline and OSG, the biggest tanker share-price gains were posted by Teekay Tankers (NYSE: TNK), up 73%, and Nordic American Tankers (NYSE: NAT), up 61%. Both companies own Suezmax tankers (with capacity of 1 million barrels), a vessel category benefiting from reroutings due to the Russia-Ukraine war. (Chart: FreightWaves based on adjusted closing price data from Yahoo Finance)

This year’s smallest tanker-stock gains were posted by product-carrier owners Scorpio Tankers (NYSE: STNG), whose adjusted share price rose 17%, and Ardmore Tankers (NYSE: ASC), with a gain of just 7%.

Tanker shares overall rose 48% on a market-cap-weighted basis, almost double the S&P 500 ETF. However, Frontline heavily skewed this average. Excluding Frontline, the remaining tanker owners’ shares rose 33% — not much higher than the broader market.

Container-ship lessor stocks

Companies that lease container vessels to shipping lines continued to report hefty profits this year despite the end of the supply chain crisis and the normalization of freight rates.

These shipowners locked in most of their fleets on multi-year charters at the peak of the COVID-era boom. That shielded this year’s returns from downside. Furthermore, liner companies have surprised analysts and brokers by continuing to book new charters at lease rates higher than pre-COVID levels.

Euroseas’ stock rose the most, but it has the smallest market cap in this group, at just $223 million.

Greece’s Danaos Corporation (NYSE: DAC) is the largest U.S.-listed player in this segment, with a market cap of $1.44 billion. Its share price rose 47% this year, close to double the gain of the S&P 500 ETF. (Chart: FreightWaves based on adjusted closing price data from Yahoo Finance)

Greece’s Costamare (NYSE: CMRE) had the smallest gain, at 19%. This company also owns a large dry bulk fleet, and its share performance was likely lowered by exposure to that segment.

U.S.-listed container-ship lessors’ average stock gain was 37% in 2023, outpacing the broader market.

Dry bulk stocks

The dry bulk sector is more exposed to the Chinese economy than any other shipping segment.

China’s post-COVID recovery was much weaker than predicted. The country’s property sector — a major driver of steel production and thus iron ore and coal imports — continued to deteriorate. Central government stimulus via infrastructure spending — a major driver of dry bulk rates after the global financial crisis — has been absent.

Spot rates for Capesizes (larger bulkers with capacity of around 180,000 deadweight tons or DWT), unexpectedly surged in the fourth quarter of this year. But in general, 2023 bulker rates have been disappointing.

According to Jefferies, spot rates for Capesizes averaged $16,500 per day from Jan. 1 through Thursday, up only 2% versus the same period last year. Rate for Panamaxes (65,000-90,000 DWT) averaged 11,000 per day, down 43% year on year. Rates for Supramaxes (45,000-60,000 DWT) averaged $11,300 per day, down 49% year on year. (Chart: FreightWaves based on adjusted closing price data from Yahoo Finance)

Rhode Island-based Pangaea Logistics (NASDAQ: PANL), an owner of midsize bulkers, is the best-performing U.S.-listed dry bulk stock of 2023, up 68% through Wednesday. Pangaea’s stock reached its highest level since 2014 on Thursday.

Greece’s Seanergy (NYSE: SHIP), which has a fleet of 17 Capesizes, came in second, up 56%. Its stock hit a new 52-week high on Wednesday. (Seanergy’s share price has also been buoyed by stock purchases by shipping magnate George Economou, who has emerged as an activist investor in recent months.)

The year’s worst performer among larger U.S.-listed bulker owners is Greece’s Diana Shipping (NYSE: DSX). Its adjusted closing price fell 14% in 2023.

Overall, U.S.-listed dry bulk stocks rose an average of 19% this year, underperforming the S&P ETF gain of 26%.

98,2023-12-27T16:37:19+00:00,What's Going On With Nvidia Stock Wednesday?,"Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock is trading higher Wednesday amid reports of the artificial intelligence kingpin taking significant strides in securing High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) by making substantial advance payments to SK Hynix and Micron Technology, Inc (NASDAQ: MU), totaling billions.

The move aims to ensure a stable supply of HBM3e for forthcoming GPU products scheduled for 2024, indicating Nvidia's proactive strategy in a highly competitive market, Digitimes reports.

This substantial prepayment, a rare move in the industry, serves Nvidia's goal of navigating the HBM market's escalating demand.

Doing so secures supply and assists memory suppliers like SK Hynix and Samsung Electronics Co (OTC: SSNLF), aiding their financial stability after a challenging year.

HBM, though in high demand, presents suppliers with significant investment challenges due to technological evolution. Enhancing Through-Silicon Via (TSV) processes to lower costs and improve yields remains a critical hurdle. Nvidia's considerable upfront investment could relieve these financial burdens and encourage HBM-related technological development.

While Samsung completed product testing for HBM3 and HBM3e and signed an HBM supply contract with Nvidia, analysts highlighted differences. Samsung's use of 1a nanometer technology might require additional processes for performance enhancement, potentially increasing costs compared to SK Hynix's 1b nanometer technology utilized in Nvidia's testing.

Nvidia's strategic investments and partnerships with key suppliers illustrate its forward-thinking approach to securing vital resources and technology for future GPU products, anticipating the ever-evolving demands of the HBM market.

Nvidia stock has gained over 244% year-to-date versus SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY)'s 25%.

The Chinese regulator-approved titles included games from gaming giants Tencent Holdings Ltd (OTC: TCEHY) and NetEase.

Last week, the National Press and Publication Administration (NPPA) implemented fresh guidelines. These regulations impose spending limits for adult players, prohibit specific in-game rewards, ban mandatory player-versus-player matches, and restrict content that breaches national security.

These rigorous actions introduced before Christmas brought back recollections of the extensive crackdown on the tech sector in 2021. That crackdown had a widespread impact on multiple industries, such as e-commerce, entertainment, and online education.

100,2023-11-24T08:20:51+00:00,12 Best Stocks In Each Sector,"In this article, we discuss the 12 best stocks in each sector. To skip the detailed analysis of how the sectors performed in 2023, go directly to the 5 Best Stocks In Each Sector.

The Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) was developed by Morgan Stanley Capital International [now MSCI Inc. (NYSE:MSCI)]. It is a framework that classifies and categorizes companies into different industry groups based on their primary business activities. The GICS has a hierarchical structure with four tiers, which are sectors, industry groups, industries, and sub-industries, written in order.

According to GICS, there are 11 sectors, which include energy, materials, industrials, consumer discretionary, consumer cyclical, healthcare, financials, information technology, communication services, utilities, and real estate. These sectors are further divided into 25 industry groups, 74 industries, and 163 sub-industries.

In 2023, the technology sector took the whole market by storm. Generative AI trends proved to be quite beneficial for the sector. The Nasdaq Composite index gained 37.34% year-to-date (YTD), compared to 19.15% YTD gains of the S&P 500 index on November 22. However, it is important to note that these gains are attributed to the companies that fall within the communication services and IT sectors. Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLK) is up nearly 50% YTD. Among the tech stocks, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been the performer of the year as the company touched the trillion-dollar market cap mark at the end of May, and its stock price is up over 240% YTD.

The worst-performing sectors have been healthcare and utilities. The healthcare sector is down 7.46 % YTD, while the utilities sector showed a decline of -5.90%. As per our previous report, the solar power segment among the utilities sector has been one of the worst performing industries in the market, as Global X Solar ETF (NASDAQ:RAYS) was down nearly 45% by the end of October. Nevertheless, November has been a better month for the industry as the ETF has gained around 6.5% since our article was posted. The financial sector hasn’t performed well either in the growing interest rate environment. Even though the sector as a whole still has positive YTD growth, the banking industry was hit quite roughly in 2023 due to the Silicon Valley Bank crisis. SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (NYSE:KRE) is down nearly 24%. Similar to the Global X Solar ETF (NASDAQ:RAYS), the SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (NYSE:KRE) has also made significant gains in November as the fund is up 11.32% month-to-date.

Market Conditions in Q3 and Future Forecast

In the first six months of the year, the S&P 500 gained nearly 16.4%, including an 8% gain in the second quarter. These gains proved to be damaging for pessimistic investors. The “Big Short” investor, Michael Burry shorted the stock market in Q2 and placed an $887 million bet against the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust and $738 million against Invesco QQQ ETF, which tracks the NASDAQ 100. The investor closed these positions in the third quarter after a probable 40% loss. Nevertheless, Burry found new targets to short in the third quarter, and he opened $47.365 million worth of PUT options against the iShares 7-10 Year Treasury Bond ETF and $7.709 million against Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG).

Compared to the first half of the year, the third quarter was less than favorable for the stock market. While the S&P 500 was up 3.11% in July, August and September showed declines of 1.77% and 4.87%, respectively. The total Q3 decline for the S&P 500 was recorded at 3.65%. It further declined by 2.20% in October but is up 7.52% month-to-date on November 22. Energy was the best-performing sector in Q3 due to an increase in prices caused by OPEC and Russia supply cuts and geopolitical tensions caused by the Israel-Hamas conflict. The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund was up nearly 11.4% in the quarter. Two of the best-performing energy stocks were Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) and Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX), gaining nearly 30% and 26%, respectively.

However, the rest of the market did not perform well. The real estate sector has been one of the worst performing sectors throughout the year and declined by 9.7% in the third quarter, while the utilities sector was down 10.1%. Even the Invesco QQQ ETF, which has been performing really well across the year and is up 47.5% YTD, declined by 3% in the third quarter.

According to a Bloomberg report, Bank of America believes that the S&P 500 index will rise around 10% from November 22 levels by the end of 2024 and close at a record 5,000. The BofA team led by Savita Subramanian wrote:

""The market has absorbed significant geopolitical shocks already and the good news is we're talking about the bad news.""

The firm further added:

""Macro signals are muddled, but idiosyncratic alpha increased this year. We're bullish not because we expect the Fed to cut, but because of what the Fed has accomplished. Companies have adapted (as they are wont to do) to higher rates and inflation.""

On the pessimistic side, Morgan Stanley doesn’t believe that the market will go up from the current levels and set the S&P 500’s 2024 target at 4,500. Goldman Sachs has a slightly better outlook at 4,700. Wells Fargo has a target between 4,600 to 4,800, and UBS keeps it at 4,700 by the end of next year.

Keeping the market conditions and forecasts in perspective, some of the best stocks to buy from different sectors include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). 12 Best Stocks In Each Sector

A close-up view of a stock market floor, traders bustling around the trading board.

Our Methodology

For this article, we chose one stock from each sector of the market as per the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS). We picked one stock from each sector that had the highest number of hedge fund investors as of the third quarter of 2023. We used Insider Monkey's proprietary database of 910 hedge funds to gauge hedge fund sentiment around stocks.

We chose SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) as our 12th stock as it tracks the S&P 500 index and stocks from all 11 sectors of the market. All of the stocks, except SPY, have been listed in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter of 2023.

Best Stocks In Each Sector

12. SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY)

Market Sector: All

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 82

SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) is an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the S&P 500 stock market index. The fund’s results and yield performance coincide with the S&P 500 index before expenses. SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) is the largest and oldest ETF in the world and was launched in 1993.

Between 2012 and 2022, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) only showed negative returns twice. Once in 2015 and later in 2022. Last year was the worst year of the decade for the fund, showing a decline of 15.53%.

Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) and iShares S&P 500 Index (IVV) also track the S&P 500 index along with SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY).

11. NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE)

Market Sector: Utilities

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58

NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) is a Florida-based energy company involved in gas infrastructure and generating and distributing electricity using different sources. The company provides its services through its subsidiaries, Florida Power & Light Company, NextEra Energy Resources, LLC, and others.

Over the last three months, 18 Wall Street analysts covered NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE)’s stock, and 14 analysts kept a Buy rating on the shares. Their average price target of $70.81 represents an upside of 23.21% as of the November 22 market close.

On November 6, NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) announced that it has agreed to sell NextEra Energy Partners, LP (NYSE:NEP)’s south Texas natural gas pipeline assets to push the company to reach its real zero 2040 goal. Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) has agreed to buy STX Midstream for $1.815 billion in cash and short-term borrowings.

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) are the best stocks in their respective sectors to buy along with NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE).

Madison Investments mentioned NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) in its third quarter 2023 investor letter. Here is what it said:

“Although NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) reported an in-line second quarter, the stock has been weak primarily because of rising interest rates. NextEra also reported slower renewables backlog growth than expected. We do not view this as an issue as we expect the development pipeline timeline may not be as predictable as investors would like. The environment for renewables remains favorable both from a demand perspective as well as cost perspective.”

10. American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT)

Market Sector: Real Estate

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 60

American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT) is a Massachusetts-based real estate investment trust that leases broadcast communications infrastructure and offers optimization of wireless communication networks.

On November 10, American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT) announced that it will strengthen its position in Africa as its subsidiary, ATC Africa, entered into a multi-year agreement with MTN Nigeria. Under the agreement, ATC Africa will provide MTN Nigeria with new tenancies, which is estimated to improve wireless connectivity across Nigeria.

On October 26, American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT) reported Q3 funds from operations (FFO) of $2.58 per share and revenue of $2.82 billion, which beat the analysts’ estimates by $0.07 and $60 million, respectively. The quarter’s property revenue grew by 7.0% to nearly $2.82 billion, while the adjusted EBITDA saw a growth of 10.4% to $1.8 billion.

American Tower Corporation (NYSE: AMT) was mentioned in Andvari Associates’ third quarter 2023 investor letter. Here is what it said:

“After good results for the first half of the year, Andvari’s performance suffered at the end of the third quarter for two reasons. First, renewed fears of interest rates remaining higher for longer impacted multiple holdings that are most sensitive to rates. These include companies like American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT) and Digital Bridge. American Tower is a REIT (real estate investment trust) that owns and leases antennae space on cell towers while Digital Bridge is an investment manager that invests in the digital infrastructure space. Both companies require debt in their operations and the prospect of higher interest rates continues to impact share prices in the short term.

As an aside, American Tower is not a new holding of Andvari. We’ve owned it in the past. Although we may have started putting American Tower back into client portfolios a bit early, we believe shares are extremely attractive. First, the shares trade at a current 3.8% dividend yield at the end of October. This yield is near the highest in American’s entire history as a public company. Second, the company will likely grow dividends per share by 9% annually over the long term. As a nice kicker, Andvari believes American Tower will sell its assets in India before year’s end, which will free up capital it can use to pay off debt and repurchase shares.”

9. Teck Resources Limited (NYSE:TECK)

Market Sector: Materials

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75

Teck Resources Limited (NYSE:TECK), formerly known as Teck Cominco, is a diversified company that is engaged in the metals and mining industry. The company’s product portfolio includes fertilizers, steelmaking coal, silver, and more.

“The major focus in Texas was spending a day visiting operations of Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP), a Stalwart investment made earlier this year.

Our investigations into the railroad industry have felt like a history lesson of the late 19th Century, a peek into the Gilded Age. At this time railroads became a transformative force that connected the East Coast to the Western frontier, pushing the economic potential of US industry and commerce to new heights. Over a century later and despite technological upheaval, the freight railroads of North America still feel just as relevant and a key part of the new industrial age.

To own, operate and invest in a railroad is to be a part of the lifeblood of North America. It is to witness the movement of grain, concrete, steel, wood, energy, autos, and shipping containers across vast distances. These are irreplaceable assets that could not be built today, and for the most part have very few substitutes – UNPs tagline “Building America” certainly rings true…” (Click here to read the full text)

101,2023-11-18T13:46:27+00:00,10 Best Performing Actively Managed ETFs in 2023,"In this piece, we will take a look at the ten best performing actively managed ETFs in 2023. If you want to skip our introduction to ETFs and the stock market in general, then take a look at the 5 Best Performing Actively Managed ETFs in 2023.

The stock market is full of all kinds of investment vehicles that can be used by professional and retail investors with different risk appetites. The most commonly discussed investment security is a stock, which is simply a representation of a company's equity and allows traders to make profits through share price appreciation or others to make money via other avenues such as dividends.

However, investing in stocks is not for everyone. While buying the shares of well established companies such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is unlikely to lead to significant losses, when the investment horizon is broadened, then the process becomes more complex. Any coverage about stocks, such as this one, comes with a disclaimer that all investment decisions should be made after consulting a qualified professional and to good effect. Investing in stocks typically requires understanding the fundamental nature of a company's business as well as being cognizant of economic realities that can affect stock indexes as a whole.

To avoid the high research required for stock investments, one popular investment vehicle is an exchange traded fund (ETF). An ETF is a collection of stocks that is typically compiled by professional financial services providers such as BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK). These are generally based either on industry sectors such as healthcare, energy, or technology, or stock and firm characteristics such as value stocks or growth stocks.

Within the ETF, there are two broad categories. These are actively managed ETFs and passively managed ETFs. As you might have guessed, actively managed ETFs have a portfolio manager in charge of regularly updating the fund. ETFs typically track a benchmark index, such as the S&P 500, and in an actively managed ETF, the portfolio manager is not constrained by the rules of the underlying index. For instance, the S&P 500 requires that any constituent firm must be profitable, and a fund manager can simply choose to ignore this if they feel that the restrictions are too tight and ignore other great stocks that can offer investors a return.

ETFs are so popular that even one of the greatest investors of our time, Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway, holds one in his investment portfolio. Insider Monkey scanned Berkshire's investments for the second quarter of 2023 and discovered that Mr. Buffett had invested $17.4 million in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY). The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) is one of the biggest ETFs in the world in terms of its net assets. Currently, these sit at $393 billion, and for those out of the loop, an ETFs net assets are the amount left over for investors after all its liabilities are subtracted from the assets. The ETF is part of the SPDR State Street Global Advisors fund family, and as the title suggests, it tracks the S&P 500 stock index managed by S&P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI). Since its inception in 1993, the ETF has gained 902% in share price appreciation, which is in line with the corresponding value of 910% for the benchmark index over the same time period. However, the ETF is passively managed, so there's little benefit in investing in it apart from the ability to receive dividends (which is undoubtedly why Mr. Buffet has invested millions of dollars in it).

Shifting gears to focus on the current stock market environment, these days, the Federal Reserve is once again back under the spotlight. November has seen several stock indexes such as the NASDAQ and the S&P post multi-day returns as investors started to speculate that the Federal Reserve might be finished with its current interest rate hiking cycle. At the heart of the current stock market chatter is the Treasury market. Treasuries, or bonds, are debt securities and their prices drop if interest rates are rising. This makes their yield shoot up, and it also raises the costs of raising capital.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell's comments that he and his team are aware of high yields and their effect on borrowing costs along with the broader economic health were what spurred the latest stock market rally. At the same time, his later comments that further hikes might be warranted to fully control the beast that is inflation also took the air out of the rallies. Volatility in the Treasury market is measured by the ICE BofAML MOVE Index (^MOVE) index, and this index is currently seven points higher than its reading at the end of June 2023 and a little over ten points higher than a recent low of 96.61 in September.

Combining all these factors, it's clear that the stock market is in no mood to be boring at the tail end of 2023. Money doesn't grow on trees, and the market is adamant that investors earn every dime of their winnings instead of just cruising along and watching their investments grow. This might also be the right time to see which stocks and ETFs have done well in 2023's turbulent environment. Therefore, we decided to dig out the best performing actively managed exchange traded funds in 2023, and the top performers are GraniteShares 1.5x Long META Daily ETF (NASDAQ:FBL), GraniteShares 1.5x Long NVDA Daily ETF (NASDAQ:NVDL), and Valkyrie Bitcoin and Ether Strategy ETF (NASDAQ:BTF).

102,2023-11-10T21:43:07+00:00,3 Recession-Resistant Stocks to Create a Multi-Asset Portfolio,"Recession-resistant stocks are essential to achieving stable, long term portfolio returns. The economy goes through periods of both economic expansions and contractions. These cycles can impact stock market returns, during both bull and bear markets.

New risks in the economy continue to emerge, keeping investors on edge. That is why its more important than ever to have a well diversified, multi-asset portfolio. While you do not have a crystal ball to tell the future, there are ways to hedge your portfolio to accommodate such risks.

Some recession-proof sectors include consumer-staples, healthcare and utilities. However, picking companies in these sectors will not guarantee you any level of success. If you’re a more risk averse investor, you’re probably better off holding mutual funds and ETFs such as SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY). However, that doesn’t mean that you can’t have a little fun with a small allocation to individual stocks.

Below are my top three recession-resistant stocks to buy right now!

S&P 500 ETF Trust is synonymous with the stock market and is the single best way to track large-cap U.S. equities. Over the last 2 decades, the S&P 500 has returned 10.20% per year. This translates to 7.47% per year on an inflation-adjusted basis. If you had invested $10,000 into the S&P 500 in 2003, assuming you re-invested the dividends, you’d have about $73,200.00 by the end of 2023.

The S&P 500 allows investors to gain exposure to the top 500 companies in the United States. It also provides investors with sector diversification, although the technology sector holds its largest weighting. Some of the sectors that the S&P 500 covers include technology, healthcare, consumer staples, financials, industrials, and energy. 

The ETF’s top 10 largest holdings include technology companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). They account for approximately 31% of the S&P 500’s total weighting. As of Nov. 6, the S&P 500’s market capitalization is estimated at $36.54 trillion. Additionally, the index has returned 14.73% year-to-date (YTD). With the new bull market on the horizon, the S&P 500 is a no-brainer recession-proof stock to buy and hold through market volatility.

Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) is a multinational conglomerate holding company headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska. The company is majority owned by legendary investor Warren Buffett. He is largely considered the greatest investor of all time. Currently, Berkshire Hathaway’s market capitalization stands at $754.32 billion.

Berkshire Hathaway has had an impressive run over the last two decades. The stock has averaged a CAGR of 10%, slightly above the S&P 500’s 9.75% during the same period. However, these numbers may be skewed and slightly less than 10%. This may be a tell tale sign, as even Warren Buffett has struggled to beat the market over the last two decades.

On Monday, Nov. 5, Berkshire Hathaway reported its third quarter 2023 financial results. The company booked its first operating loss for the year of $12.77 billion, with operating earnings climbing 40% to $10.76 billion. Berkshire Hathaway is currently sitting on a record cash pile of $157.2 billion, as Warren Buffett seeks attractive returns in short-dated U.S. treasuries. If you’re looking for increased portfolio protection, Berkshire Hathaway is among the best recession-resistant stocks to consider.

SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) Gold bars and Financial concept, studio shots. Costco's gold bars, cost stock

SPDR Gold Shares (NYSEARCA:GLD) is an ETF that seeks to track the spot price of physical gold bullion. It is the largest ETF to invest directly into physical gold. The ETF is managed by State Street Global Advisors, the world’s 4th largest asset manager with approximately $3.6 trillion in AUM.

SPDR Gold Shares is unique in that it offers a relatively cost effective way to gain exposure to physical gold bullion. It is a much safer way to gain access to the gold market, rather than investing into gold mining stocks. Investors can sleep better at night knowing that they are less exposed to the cyclicality of the gold mining sector.

Some of the largest hedge funds and institutions in the world hold SPDR Gold Shares including Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates and Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. There are a number of different ways to hedge your portfolio, and smart money tends to believe that a hard asset class like Gold should not be ignored. In 2023, the price of Gold rose more than 15% YTD as a result of ongoing macroeconomic headwinds threatening economic stability. If you want exposure to a hard asset, consider GLD as one of your best bets.

While momentum seems to have slowed as stocks pulled back recently, Bank of America believes there's more upside on the horizon.

On Sept. 20, the bank raised its year-end price target on the S&P 500 from 4,300 to 4,600. Considering that the benchmark index currently sits at 4,320, the new target implies a potential upside of 6.5%.

Passive income investments are one of the most trusted methods for riding out a recession. Here are 3 high-yield options to add significant income to your portfolio. Investing in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes and you only need $100.

According to Savita Subramanian, head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy at BofA Global Research, productivity is one of the reasons behind the optimistic outlook.

""AI (artificial intelligence) is part of this, as are automation, right-sizing labor and wage inflation incentives after a decade of easy, financially engineered earnings growth. Productivity would likely drive the equity risk premium (ERP) lower,"" she wrote in a research note.

And it's not just tech stocks that stand to capitalize on this trend. Subramanian noted that ""old economy"" companies could benefit as much as tech and growth, but this theme has not been priced in ""as richly.""

Sentiment is another reason the market could have another leg up.

""Sentiment is more bearish than bullish, our Sell-Side Indicator implies +15% over the next 12 months,"" Subramanian said.

Still, if you want to capitalize on the projected upside in the benchmark index, you might want to consider a different strategy than simply buying the first S&P 500 exchange-traded fund (ETF) you see.

How To ‘Handily Outperform' The Benchmark

The standard S&P 500 Index is market cap weighted, so larger companies with higher market capitalizations have a greater impact on the index's performance.

Story continues

But there's also an equal-weighted S&P 500, which gives each company in the index an equal weight. This means the performance of each company has the same influence on the overall index value.

According to Subramanian, the equal-weight index has an edge in the current situation.

""The less expensive equal-weighted S&P 500 should handily outperform its cap-weighted counterpart, and value sectors like financials and energy should outperform from here,"" she said.

Investors have long been using ETFs to gain exposure to popular stock market indices. For instance, the market-cap-weighted SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) is the largest ETF in the world as measured by assets under management.

The good news? You can use ETFs to access equal-weighted indices, too.

For instance, if you want to track the equal-weighted S&P 500, you can look into the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (NYSE:RSP). RSP is based on the S&P 500 Equal Weight Index and invests at least 90% of its total assets in securities that comprise the index. Both the fund and the index are rebalanced quarterly.

RSP has a total expense ratio of 0.2%.

""What I anticipate is going to happen here — while we still have full employment, which is remarkable — and you don't put any capital into the small business sector, which is 60% of the jobs in America, you're going to start to see some real chaos come September, October, November,"" he said.

‘No Bidenomics For Them'

Monetary policy is in the hands of the Federal Reserve. But according to O'Leary, the issue extends beyond the central bank.

""This is an issue for Congress, Larry. It's very simple,"" he said. ""They gave all their money to S&P 500 in two acts, the Chips and Science Act and the other, Inflation Reduction Act. Not a dime for small business. A trillion for the big boys, nothing for the small guys. And the small guys, they run America, so it has to be rebalanced somewhere.""

It’s not the first time for O'Leary to highlight this problem. As an investor in numerous businesses, he has felt the impact first-hand.

""I was on the Hill yesterday. I was banging the drum up and down the halls saying, ‘Everybody, let's wake up to what's happening to my small companies.' I got 34-plus companies. They can't raise a dime. There's no Bidenomics for them. They have no capital,"" he said in a Fox News Interview in July.

An Opportunity For Investors

As O'Leary pointed out, there's one group of companies that stand to benefit from the government's massive spending bills — the S&P 500.

""If you're an S&P 500 company, you've got clear sailing for the next three to four years,"" he said in a separate interview last month.

If you share O'Leary's view and want to invest in the S&P 500, there are many exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that provide convenient access to the group.

For instance, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) was launched in 1993 and now has $412.8 billion in assets under management. It tracks the price and yield performance of the S&P 500 Index and has an expense ratio of 0.0945%.

Investors can also look into similar exchange-traded funds (ETFs) from other issuers, such as the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:IVV) and the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:VOO). These funds have expense ratios of 0.03%.

While the benchmark index showed impressive gains in 2023, it's not always smooth sailing. Last year, the S&P 500 tumbled 19.6%.

If you don't like that kind of volatility, you might want to look into reliable income plays outside the stock market — such as investing in rental properties with as little as $100 while staying completely hands-off.

106,2023-09-01T20:56:45+00:00,How have shipping shares performed versus broader stock market?,"LPG shipping, midsize crude-tanker shipping and select container-shipping shares have outperformed. (Photo: Shutterstock/ Dmitrii Sapegin)

Ocean shipping stocks are not “buy-and-hold” investments. Shipping is a highly cyclical industry; the stocks require market timing. Non-insiders who hold shipping stocks for long periods are generally either “buy-and-wait” investors waiting for a cyclical upturn to pay off or “bag holders” who didn’t sell when the cycle turned down and are sitting on their losses.

How have shipping stocks fared so far this year, and how have they done over the longer term?

FreightWaves compared price changes for a selection of shipping stocks to a common buy-and-hold option: the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE: SPY), a leading exchange-traded fund that’s a proxy for the broader stock market.

Price changes using data from Koyfin (which adjusts prices for dividend payments) were tracked across various shipping sectors both year to date (YTD) and over the past four years, a timeframe that compares pre-COVID stock levels to current levels.

The comparisons show that several shipping stocks have performed better than SPY in both the shorter and longer terms.

Container shipping stocks

The pattern for many shipping equities this year has been: up in January and February, down in March-June, then a divergence this summer, with some rebounding and others not.

Container shipping stocks have done surprisingly well given the gloomy sector outlook. The stock of niche ocean carrier Matson (NYSE: MATX) tops this sector’s ranking. Matson shares have been on the upswing since April and have risen more than twice as much as SPY. Matson was up 41% through Thursday’s close versus SPY’s 18% YTD rise.

Container-ship lessor Danaos Corp (NYSE: DAC) has also outperformed the broader market indicator, up 27%. Change in adjusted closing price, adjusted for dividends. (All charts: Koyfin)

At the bottom of the spectrum are ocean carriers Maersk (Copenhagen: MAERSKB) and Zim (NYSE: ZIM), down 20% and 30% YTD, respectively, adjusted for dividends. These stocks began falling this year in March and have not recovered, far underperforming SPY.

Most container shipping stocks are still topping the S&P 500 ETF on a four-year basis despite the fact that the market peaked last year after pandemic effects wound down. Danaos is up 832% from August 2019, according to Koyfin data. Shares owned by the company’s sponsor, John Coustas, are currently worth $604 million.

Tanker stocks

Tanker stocks regained some of their forward momentum this summer, rising through July and the first half of August, then given back a portion of their gains toward the end of last month.

Overseas Shipping Group (NYSE: OSG) — which leads the pack — has not followed the typical tanker-stock price pattern. Its shares have steadily risen throughout the year; it’s up 52% YTD. OSG focuses on the Jones Act (U.S. coastwise) trade, a completely different market than other listed tanker names.

The other tanker stocks that have beaten SPY — Frontline (NYSE: FRO), Teekay Tankers (NYSE: TNK) and Nordic American Tankers (NYSE: NAT) — are up 45%, 32% and 28% YTD, respectively. All three have exposure to the midsize crude-tanker sector. chart of tanker shipping stocks

Numerous tanker stocks have done worse than SPY in 2023. Product tanker stocks are at the bottom. The adjusted share price of Scorpio Tankers (NYSE: STNG) was down 6% YTD through Thursday, with Admore Shipping (NYSE: ASC) down 14%.

Looking at the longer-term view, the top tanker names have all outperformed the S&P 500 ETF on a four-year basis.

Tanker equities did much worse than the broader stock market in the second half of 2020 through the first half of 2022 as a result of COVID demand fallout, but have more than made up for lost ground since then.

Teekay Tanker’s adjusted price is up 358% since late August 2019, according to Koyfin data. chart of tanker shipping stocks

Gas shipping stocks

Gas shipping stocks fall in two groups: shares of owners of specialized tankers carrying pressurized liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) — propane and butane — and shares of owners of specialized tankers carrying supercooled liquefied natural gas (LNG).

LPG shipping stocks have been star performers in both the short and long terms, led by companies that own very large gas carriers (VLGCs), vessels that serve high-volume, long-haul LPG trades. Panama Canal congestion is now adding to VLGC upside, creating supply-side ineffiencies that support spot rates.

The adjusted share price of Avance Gas (Oslo: AGAS) was up 79% YTD through Thursday, more than four times SPY’s gains. Shares of BW LPG (Oslo: BWLG) were up 70% and those of Dorian LPG (NYSE: LPG) were up 36%.

Most of the previously listed LNG carrier owners have been taken private. One of the remaining pure LNG carrier owners is Flex LNG (NYSE: FLNG). Another is CoolCo, which was not included in the survey due to the recency of its listing. Flex LNG’s stock has been relatively flat this year, down 7% as of Thursday.

Looking at gas-shipping stock performance over a four-year timeframe, Flex LNG is second best, after Avance. Gas carrier stocks have performed three to four times as well as the broader stock-market benchmark since late August 2019, with the exception of Navigator Gas (NYSE: NVGS), which specializes in smaller LPG carriers and has been roughly on par with SPY.

Dry bulk stocks

The dry bulk stocks have been the laggards in public shipping markets this year.

Dry bulk shipping rates are heavily exposed to the Chinese economy. News out of China continues to worsen. Listed dry bulk stocks have been falling since March — and they’re still falling.

The adjusted share price of Golden Ocean (NASDAQ: GOGL) has declined the most, down 16% YTD, according to Koyfin data. Eagle Bulk (NYSE: EGLE) is down 12%, Genco Shipping and Trading (NYSE: GNK) 11% and Star Bulk (NYSE: SBLK) 9%. chart of dry bulk shipping stocks

The longer-term chart for dry bulk stocks highlights the importance of market timing.

Port restrictions in China tied up dry bulk shipping capacity in congestion during the pandemic, pushing up rates. Dry bulk stocks enjoyed a huge run-up between early 2021 and mid-2022. However, as a result of declines in the second half of last year and 2023 YTD, most dry bulk names are now underperforming SPY on a four-year basis. chart of dry bulk shipping stocks

Looking even longer term

The fact that several shipping stocks have done better than the broader stock-market measure between the end of August 2019 and Thursday doesn’t imply they’re buy-and-hold investment material. It merely relates to where various shipping segments were in their respective cycles four years ago versus where they are today.

Looking even longer term, at a 10-year time horizon, SPY has risen at more than twice the pace of almost all shipping stocks.

There are two outliers: BW LPG’s adjusted share price increased 162% over the past 10 years, almost matching SPY’s gain of 175%. And Matson’s adjusted price is up 225% since late August 2013, making it the only shipping stock to outpace the SPDR S&P 500 index ETF across the span of a decade. chart of 10-year shipping stock performance

107,2023-09-01T02:23:53+00:00,16 Best High Volume Stocks To Buy Today,"In this piece, we will take a look at the 16 best high volume stocks to buy today. If you want to skip our introduction to different metrics of stock trading, then head on over to 5 Best High Volume Stocks To Buy Today.

One way in which technology has impacted the financial world is the ability to monitor trends in share movements. Investing in the market can be done through multiple approaches. One of these involves analyzing a firm's financial statements to determine current performance and future prospects. The other involves analyzing market trends and seeing which stocks are currently generating interest. Interest in a stock on the stock market can be either negative or positive, and some indicators that can be used to gauge investor sentiment are the relative strength index (RSI), short interest, and volume of shares traded.

The relative strength index is a mathematical computation that analyzes whether shares of a firm are overbought or oversold. It is also used to determine whether the share price is about to reverse a trend, with the chart's inability to either cross or meet previous highs or lows thought to be bearish or bullish indicators. For more details about oversold and overbought stocks, you can check out 10 Oversold Growth Stocks To Buy.

The short interest in a stock is the number of shares that have been sold short on the market. Short selling, for the uninitiated, attempts to profit from negative share price movement by rooting out inconsistencies in management or the overall business model. Short sellers either buy options that enable them to sell shares at high prices or directly sell the stock on the market after borrowing it. To see which stocks are currently on the short seller radar and a detailed explanation of what short selling is, you might be interested in 16 Most Shorted Stocks Right Now.

Finally, a rather simple metric to see what's happening in the market right now is the volume of shares traded. Rather self explanatory in nature, this just takes a look at the shares that are changing hands right now. Unlike the previous two indicators, however, it can not help in gauging the sentiment behind these transactions. So, the volume of shares traded has to be combined with other indicators, such as the share price gain or loss and moving averages for several time periods to understand the underlying reasons behind market events. Additionally, the volume itself is often measured and compared by dividing the current volume with multiple month averages to truly determine whether anything unusual is happening around a stock.

This is because the singular reading of a stock's volume is based on its liquidity and shares floating on the market. These factors are often crucial determinants of returns and pricing as well since stocks with low liquidity (or low demand or supply of the shares) can often lead to 'flash crashes' as the price rapidly deteriorates. Finally, the volume of a stock is also influenced by its popularity as large and mega cap stocks often have more liquidity and greater volume while other, smaller firms can lag in this area. Of course, volume is not limited to stocks only, and instead, it measures sentiment surrounding any security that is being traded on a market, whether it's a stock, an exchange traded fund (ETF), or a currency. We recently took a look at 20 Biggest ETFs by Volume and found that the top three were ProShares UltraPro Short QQQ (NASDAQ:SQQQ), ProShares UltraPro QQQ (NASDAQ:TQQQ), and SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY).

Renowned Strategist Tom Lee Says Inflation Is On A Straight Line To Sub-2% By The Middle Of Next Year — Here's What He Likes Right Now,"Inflation has been a big concern for both the Federal Reserve and investors. But according to Tom Lee, co-founder and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, this concern will soon diminish.

""I think inflation is on a glide path towards sub three, sub two by the middle of next year,"" Lee said on CNBC recently.

In July, the consumer price index (CPI) rose 3.2% from a year ago. Core CPI, which excludes food and energy, showed a 12-month increase of 4.7%. Both metrics increased by 0.2% month over month.

Lee explained that shelter costs, which have been driving core inflation, will ""start to cool."" He also sees ""a lot more downside"" in used car prices.

Check out:

Investing in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. With as little as $100, average investors are becoming landlords thanks to this Jeff Bezos-backed startup. Elon Musk has reportedly bought 6,000 acres of land just outside of Austin. Here’s how to invest in the city’s growth before he floods it with new tech workers.

""I think we could print something pretty low, because when shelter goes to zero then you could have core at zero,"" he noted.

The Fed has raised interest rates significantly to stabilize price levels. It has an inflation target of 2% — so some are concerned that there would still be room for further tightening. But if Lee is right and inflation falls to under 2%, the central bank might reconsider its stance and potentially ease its monetary policy.

And that could lead to opportunities for investors.

New High For S&P 500

The U.S. stock market saw robust growth in 2023, with the S&P 500 climbing 15%.

Lee sees further upside ahead. He has a year-end price target of 4,825 for the S&P 500, nearly 10% above where the index currently sits.

The Wall Street strategist pointed out that ""there's $5.5 trillion of cash on the sidelines."" And while many people expect the Fed to remain hawkish, Lee believes the market can absorb one more rate hike.

Story continues

""I think you have an earnings recovery, Fed may be slowing, interest rates could stabilize and then the cash gets put to work,"" he added.

If you share this bullish view and want to invest in the S&P 500, there are several exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that provide convenient access to the benchmark index. Investors can look into names like the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:IVV) and the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:VOO)

Bitcoin To $180,000

Lee has long been a proponent of Bitcoin, and he isn't shy about issuing bold price targets.

In the CNBC segment, he pointed out a significant catalyst for the world's largest cryptocurrency.

""We're in the window where we'll start to see the potential for SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF,"" Lee said. ""If the spot Bitcoin [ETF] gets approved, I think the demand will be greater than the daily supply of Bitcoin. And so the clearing price — this is done by Sean Farrell, who's our crypto digital strategist — is over $150,000. It could even be like $180,000.""

Considering that Bitcoin currently trades at $25,900 apiece, $180,000 would imply a potential upside of 595%. Lee emphasized that this target hinges on a spot Bitcoin ETF being approved in the U.S.

One of the things that makes Bitcoin appealing is that its total supply is capped at 21 million coins. This stands in stark contrast with fiat currencies, which can be printed at will by central banks.

While Bitcoin does not offer a yield, new companies have innovated ways for people to earn passive income from inflation-resistant assets. For instance, you can now invest in rental properties with as little as $100 while staying completely hands-off.

Shipping stocks have a long tradition of defying expectations. At the beginning of 2023, sentiment was ebullient on crude tanker and product tanker shares. The word “supercycle” was bandied about. Global fuel demand was bouncing back from COVID, sanctions on Russia were inflating voyage distances, and the ratio of tanker tonnage on order to tonnage on the water was historically low.

Dry bulk shares were also expected to rise. As with tankers, the dry bulk orderbook was exceptionally slim. China would rebound quickly from COVID, the theory went, ramping up dry bulk demand as the year progressed.

On the negative side, a large number of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) carriers —  specialized tankers that carry propane — were poised for delivery in 2023, darkening sentiment on LPG shipping stocks as the year began.

Sentiment on container shipping stocks was even worse. Freight rates and ship leasing rates were plunging. A predicted recession was set to curb future demand. The orderbook-to-fleet ratio was an ominous 30% and a tidal wave of newbuildings would hit the market starting in March.

So, over halfway through 2023, what actually happened to shipping stocks?

Container shipping has been the best-performing U.S.-listed sector year to date, on average. Gas shipping has been the second best. Tanker stocks are trailing behind containers and gas shipping, while dry bulk shares have performed the worst on average.

This is not what was expected at the beginning of the year.

Shipping stocks by sector vs. SPY

FreightWaves analyzed adjusted closing prices (adjusted to account for dividends) from Dec. 30, 2022, through Monday of 22 U.S.-listed stocks of shipowners with market capitalizations of at least $400 million. Companies with offshore interests were excluded, as were larger owners that listed after Jan. 1.

Performance of the main shipping sectors (using a non-market-cap-weighted average of surveyed shipping shares in those sectors) was compared to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY), one of the most popular vehicles to invest in the broader equity market.

March marked a major turning point for shipping stocks. In January and February, shipping stocks outperformed the broader market. Since March, shipping stocks on average have underperformed the market, albeit with different trends for different segments.

To examine the effect of the March turning point, shipping stocks were compared to SPY year to date (YTD) as well as in January-February and March onwards. SPY’s percentage changes in these three time periods were virtually identical to changes in the average of the three main indexes — the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite — making SPY a good proxy for the broader market.

Shares of the 22 shipping stocks included in the analysis are up an average of 8% YTD, less than half the 19% YTD gain of SPY.

Container shipping stocks are up an average of 21%, edging out broader stock market gains. Gas shipping stocks are up an average of 18% YTD and tankers 9%. Mixed-fleet owners are down 2% and dry bulk owners are down 8% YTD. (All charts: FreightWaves based on adjusted closing price data from Yahoo Finance)

Tankers and dry bulk stocks rose the most in January and February, 32% and 30%, respectively. But they also fell the most between March 1 and Monday, 18% and 29%, respectively, in a period when SPY rose 15%. Larger-cap container shipping and gas shipping stocks, on average, did not fall like tanker and dry bulk stocks did over the past four and a half months.

Container shipping stocks

The container shipping stocks have done surprisingly well given the gloom in the container business due to overcapacity and excess goods inventories.

The adjusted closing price of container-ship lessor Danaos (NYSE: DAC) is up 29% YTD, as is the price of Hawaii-based niche ocean carrier Matson (NYSE: MATX). Container-ship lessor Global Ship Lease (NYSE: GSL) is up 24%. The outlier — and worst performer among U.S.-listed container shipping stocks — is Israel-based ocean carrier Zim (NYSE: ZIM). Its adjusted stock price (accounting for a large dividend payout) has suffered a 27% pullback since March. Zim shares are significantly underperforming the broader market YTD.

Liquefied gas shipping stocks

Listed gas shipowners include LPG carrier owners and liquefied natural gas carriers owners. The two U.S.-listed LPG carrier owners with market caps over $400 million are Dorian LPG (NYSE: LPG) and Navigator Holdings (NYSE: NVGS). Their adjusted closing prices are up 43% and 12% YTD, respectively.

Dorian, which owns very large gas carriers (VLGCs), is the best-performing U.S.-listed shipping stock YTD. Despite a large influx of VLGC newbuildings, high demand has pushed up VLGC spot rates to nearly triple the trailing five-year average, according to data from Clarksons.

In the LNG shipping market, most of the previously listed owners have gone private. The adjusted share price of Flex LNG (NYSE: FLNG) is flat YTD, with January-February gains counterbalanced by declines since then. (Another large pure LNG carrier owner, Coolco, was not included in the survey because it listed on NYSE in March.)

Tanker shipping stocks

Tanker shipping stocks have been an extremely mixed bag. Stock performance has hinged on the type of tankers that are owned. Shares of owners of mid-sized tankers are still doing very well. Stocks of several owners of very large crude carriers (VLCCs) have given back earlier gains, but are still even to slightly up on the year. Shares of product tanker owners are down.

The big three gainers YTD are Frontline (NYSE: FRO), Nordic American Tankers (NYSE: NAT) and Teekay Tankers (NYSE: TNK), up 39%, 32% and 29%, respectively — handily outperforming SPY despite pullbacks in recent months.

VLCC owners International Seaways (NYSE: INSW), DHT (NYSE: DHT) and Euronav (NYSE: EURN) have underperformed the broader market through mid-July.

The overall tanker sector average has been pulled down by product tanker owners Torm (NASDAQ: TRMD), Ardmore Shipping (NYSE: ASC) and Scorpio Tankers (NYSE: STNG), whose shares have fallen significantly over recent months.

Scorpio is the worst performer among the larger U.S.-listed shipping names. Its adjusted close on Monday was down 20% YTD.

Mixed-fleet stocks

Among the larger mixed-fleet players, Costamare (NYSE: CMRE) owns container ships and bulkers, and Navios Partners (NYSE: NMM) owns container ships, tankers and bulkers. (Ship Finance International was not covered by the survey due to its offshore interests.)

Mixed-fleet shares followed the general shipping trend: rising in January and February and pulling back since then. Costamare is up 9% YTD. Navios Partners is down 12%.

Dry bulk stocks

Dry bulk offers a particularly clear example of shipping’s March turning point, likely due to dry bulk’s high exposure to the Chinese economy. China’s post-COVID Chinese recovery has been much weaker than expected. Current dry bulk spot rates are down double digits from their five-year trailing average, according to Clarksons data.

The four U.S.-listed pure dry bulk owners with market caps over $400 million all followed the same pattern. Shares rose by double digits in the first two months of the year, then gave back those gains and more. All are underperforming SPY, although not by as much as the product-tanker subsector.

The adjusted close of Star Bulk (NYSE: SBLK) was down 4% YTD through Monday, with Genco (NYSE: GNK) down 8%, Eagle Bulk (NYSE: EGLE) down 9% and Golden Ocean (NASDAQ: GOGL) down 11%.

This was the second surprise this year for the ‘business as usual’ beverage giant and the Coca Cola Company (NYSE: KO) rival, both being valuable members of the S&P 500 and holdings of its trailing ETF index, SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY).

Second Quarter Highlights

For the second quarter, net sales rose 10.4% to $22.32 billion, topping the expected $21.73 billion, according to Refinitiv. When the impact of acquisitions and divestitures is excluded, organic revenue expanded 13%.

Net income attributable to the company rose from $1.43 billion made during last year’s comparable quarter to $2.75 billion, or $1.99 per share with adjusted earnings per share amounting to $2.09, topping the expected $1.96.

Volume Was Hurt By Higher Prices

Higher prices for Pepsi snacks and drinks resulted in a volume drop of 3%, with beverages falling 1%, when pricing and currency fluctuations are excluded. As for North America, Quaker Foods volume dropped 5%, and beverage volume contracted 4.5% but Frito-Lay told a different story by experiencing 1% growth owed to new innovations in the division.

Improved 2023 Guidance

Coca Cola rival materially hiked its full-year outlook, as to suggest the momentum in the business will be sustained. Pepsi rose its revenue forecast from prior 8% organic growth to 10%. Constant currency earnings outlook was also hiked to 12% growth from its previous expectation of 9%.

PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta underlined that these results are proof to the beverage company’s successfully executing its Pepsi+ strategic-end-to-end initiative to become faster, stronger and better organized.

Coca Cola Also Sees A Strong Long-term Perspective

Even the world’s largest beverage is company is squeezed by the sluggish macroeconomic environment. But Coca Cola did a great job at rebounding from the pandemic, improving its profitability and returning to growth. According to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, Coca Cola shares dipped 5% in the first half of the year. But Coca Cola owes its success to quickly taking adequate action in times of crisis. During the pandemic, it quickly adapted its operational structure and slashed its brand collection to focus on top performers, resulting in stabilized profits and rising sales. In simple words, Coca-Cola keeps on demonstrating why it's a top blue chip stock but both Pepsi and Coca Cola are not having it easy with persistently high inflation that is hurting their consumers and a gloomy market dynamic.

112,2023-07-05T21:39:07+00:00,Constellation Brands - A Diversified Tale Of Making The Best Of A Slow Growth Industry,"Unlike Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ: QQQ) that is all about the tech stocks changing the world, the S&P 500 is more about what makes the world, as as its members, also held by SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY) that is designed to follow the index, tell the tale of economic health and stability.

SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust is the largest and oldest ETF in the word. In January, this first U.S. exchange-traded fund turned 30, followed by its tech peer the Invesco QQQ Trust that was launched in 1999 in the dotcom bubble era and the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE: GLD) that debuted in the early stages of a commodity boom back in 2004.

The Diversified Tale Of Constellation Brands

Constellation Brands Inc (NYSE: STZ) might not be in the S&P but it is a Fortune 500 company, the largest beer import company in the US by sales with the third-largest market share of all major beer suppliers. Beer is one of the original alcoholic beverages that was developed at the dawn of human civilization and is now a staple of the world’s economy. So, Constellation’s tale does reflect a lot of macroeconomic conditions. But what’s interesting about Constellation is that it is one of the largest diversified beverage companies around. Along with its well known beer brands, Corona, Modelo, and Pacifico and several wine and spirits brands, it also owns almost 40% of Canopy Growth Corporation (NASDAQ: CGC), a deal that for now has not lived up to expectations as last October, Constellations wrote down the value of its stake in Canopy Growth by as much as $1.06 billion.

Until recently, Constellation was enjoying a double-digit-percentage sales growth from its beer brands which account for almost three-quarters of its revenue and almost 80% of its total profits. But growth is now slowing down to a single-digit-percentage pace, joined by rising input costs. However, only 30% of Constellation’s operating profit margin is dependent on this alcoholic beverage.

The beer industry is dominated by massive conglomerates like Heineken (OTC: HEINY) the world’s second largest brewer and even Heineken warned earlier this ear that full year operating profit would grow but at a slower rate due to an economic slowdown despite beer drinking having returned to pre-pandemic levels that fueled a better-than-expected 2022 profit.

Constellation’s Revamping Seems To Be Working

On Friday, Constellation Brands reported better than expected Q1 results due to a more than 40% improvement in e-commerce direct to consumer sales, showing that consumers are successfully adopting D2C digital channels. CEO Bill Newland revealed that the company’s omnichannel strategy resulted in the creation of additional pillars of consumer-led growth, such as international and D2C, with the later boosting the channel’s net sales 13% in the reported quarter.

View more earnings on QQQ

Wells Fargo analysts noted that the May quarter was the first sequential relief and quarterly improvement in nearly two years, despite higher-than-expected marketing sending as Constellation has been learning from its soda business to induce drive beer growth.

Constellations maintained its fiscal year 2024 guidance, guiding for EPS in the range of $11.70 to $12.00, excluding its Canopy Growth. Net sales growth is expected in the range between 7% and 9% for beer, while organic wine and spirits are guided in the range between negative 0.5% and positive 0.5%.

Debt Somewhat Spoils The Picture

Unlike Boston Beer, Constellation has debt, and this is an often occurrence at massive global beer conglomerates in this slow-growth industry.

As of May 2023, Constellation Brands owed $12.3 billion of debt, which means it added $11 billion, with the figure being comprised of short-term liabilities amounting to $3.19 billion long-term liabilities of $12.7 billion. On the other side is $192.5 million in cash along with receivables valued at $933.1 million due within 12 months. Therefore, liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and near-term receivables by $14.7 billion. Fortunately, Constellation Brands has a market cap of $45.1 billion so it is able to raise capital. But, with debt being 3.7 times its EBITDA, its EBIT cover its interest expense 6.7 times over and its EBIT have dropped 7.3% in the last twelve months. If earnings continue to decline, debt will become an issue.

Although the balance sheet is the place to look at when there’s debt in question, in Constellation’s case, it is future earnings that will more than anything determine its fate.

113,2023-07-03T18:29:05+00:00,"While Tesla's Electric Pickup Know-How Is Still In The Works, Worksport Opens Its R&amp;D Center In The U.S.","It’s a common fact that pickups are the backbone of the automotive industry which is why their electric counterparts are considered essential to the EV transformation that is upon the industry. This particular vehicle has even caused a headache to the EV king Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) whose Cybertruck is expected to arrive later this year after several delays since it was unveiled back in 2019. Because of their size and capability, these electrified workhorses have emerged as a symbol of progress and efficiency that the EV revolution is promising to the transport industry. But, with Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN) and Ford Motor (NYSE: F) being among the rare ones who brought this vehicle to life on the road, many have started wondering the electric pickup promise is just a dream.

While even Tesla is on a long learning curve when it comes to the electric pickup-know, Worksport Ltd (NASDAQ: WKSP) whose solar-powered tonneau cover will be empowering Hyundai’s Santa Cruz pickup, just revealed it will be opening its cutting-edge automotive product R&D Center in the heart of the U.S. which is known for its truck culture.

Worksport’s U.S. R&D Center A Diverse Group Of Cutting-edge Nasdaq-100 Companies

Worksport has chosen Springfield, MO for its research facility that will be hosting an impressive arsenal of over 70 patents across the automotive, consumer products, manufacturing, and agricultural sectors. Know-how that has been documented throughout Worksport’s intellectual property is one of the company’s key competitive advantages that will now be nurtured and further strengthened while Worksport’s 220,000 square feet manufacturing facility in West Seneca, N.Y. prepares to launch production. The reason why Worksport chose to place its R&D efforts at a separate location is to prevent its focus on innovation to get diluted by daily manufacturing operations. This way, Worksport will be able to refine its operations along the way while incubating new ground-breaking ideas in line with the company’s ambitious expansion plans, led by the development of its SOLIS solar-powered tonneau cover and COR remote power and storage system. The R&D team will be able to follow up with new truck models so the company is able to craft its offerings and refine its existing ones by responding to crucial feedback data.

Through its intellectual creations, Worksport is clearly showing the world how will electric pickups change the world: from empowering us to thrive in what used to be inaccessible locations to conquering landscapes in a greener manner that gives hope of a more sustainable future, these trucks are more than vehicles, they are a fusion of cutting-edge technology and responsible innovation that aims to make the world a better place. This segment is also notoriously hard to break into with many brand partnerships that could also give Tesla a headache as it aims to keep everything in-house.

Tesla Pulled The Indexes Along For A Great June Ride

The S&P 500 had its best monthly performance since October as it gained 6.5% while the Nasdaq rose 6.6%, both pulling out a fourth consecutive positive month. As for the second quarter, the S&P 500 rose 8.3% for a third straight quarter of gains which is its biggest quarterly advance since 2021’s Q4, while the Nasdaq jumped 12.8%. During the first half of 2023, the S&P 500 popped 15.9%, marking its best first half since 2019 while the Nasdaq surged 31.7% which is its best first half since 1983.

Tesla, that makes 4.24% (according to data from June 29th, 2023) of the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NYSE: QQQ) that includes diverse group of cutting-edge Nasdaq 100 companies that are at the forefront of transformative long-term themes, enjoyed its shares going up 109% year-to-date due to the EV and AI hype combined. Tesla has been on an impressive run since General Motors (NYSE: GM), Ford Motor and Rivian announced they will be adopting its charging standard. During the relentless rise of the tech-focused Nasdaq, Tesla has also propped up the the S&P 500 index. With a market cap of approximately $830 billion, Tesla is also part of the holdings of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY).

Electric Pickups Could Easily Shake Things Up In The EV Revolution

Even Nissan Motor Co Ltd (OTC: NSANY) is reportedly thinking of an electric pickup it unveiled it is planning to launch as many as 19 EVs by the end of the decade, while announcing it will be committing $500 million to convert its Canton Assembly plant to EV production and this is where it used to make its Frontier and Titan pickups. Also one of the reasons why pickups are such a lucrative market is their aftermarket filled with purchasable addons. Pickup drivers like to personalize their vehicles which will be an opportunity for Worksport and it will be interesting to see if Tesla will be willing to play along for a change.

114,2023-07-03T18:02:51+00:00,How To Earn $500 A Month From SPY Stock,"Last month, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) marked a milestone as it closed above the threshold that delineated its exit from the longest bear market since 1948.

Rising 0.6% to close at 4,293.93 on June 8, it registered a gain of more than 20% from its low on Oct. 12, 2022.

The bear market ran for 248 trading days, making it the lengthiest since the 484-day run that ended on May 15, 1948.

The ongoing exit from bear to bull market offers a chance for investors to reassess their investment strategies, one of which could be taking advantage of dividend yields.

That’s where SPY, the S&P 500 ETF, comes into play.

Investing in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. With as little as $100, average investors are becoming landlords thanks to this Jeff Bezos-backed startup. Blackstone made a $13 billion bet on the growth in student housing. Here's how you can carve out your own piece of the student housing market with just $500.

SPY currently has a dividend yield of 1.47%. So how would you yield $500 from it? Potential capital appreciation aside, let's do some math.

To earn $500 a month, or $6,000 annually, with a dividend yield of 1.47%, you would need an investment of about $408,163, which equates to around 920 shares of SPY.

If you’re aiming for a more modest amount, say $100 a month ($1,200 annually), you’d need an investment of approximately $81,633, translating to about 184 shares of SPY.

Here’s how we calculate it: $6,000 / 0.0147 = $408,163 ($500 per month, $6,000 annually). $1,200 / 0.0147 = $81,663($100 per month, $1,200 annually).

Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.

The dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change.

For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. If the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60).

Conversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40).

Further, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease.

117,2023-03-29T18:37:23+00:00,UK To Deeply Scrutinize Broadcom-Vmware Deal,"On March 29, Britain's Competition and Markets Authority referred to the anticipated takeover of Vmware, Inc (NYSE: VMW) by Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ: AVGO) for an in-depth investigation for concerns over the substantial lessening of competition within the U.K. markets. The Phase 2 investigation has a statutory deadline of September 12, 2023. On March 22, 2023, Broadcom informed the CMA that it would not offer any undertakings to the CMA in the five days after it published its concerns. Last December, the European Commission launched an in-depth investigation to assess, under the EU Merger Regulation, the proposed acquisition. The Commission's preliminary investigation indicated restricted competition in the supply of NICs, FC HBAs, and storage adapters leading to higher prices, lower quality, and less innovation for business customers and consumers. The watchdog will also examine whether Broadcom may hinder the development of SmartNICs by other providers. Another examination point is whether Broadcom may start bundling VMware's virtualization software with its software reducing choice and potentially foreclosing rival software providers. The Commission now has until May 11, 2023, to decide. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission sought information about the deal from the companies. The deal would further Broadcom's push into software, nearly tripling the size of the company's software division. Broadcom shares gained 13% YTD versus the broader index SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY), which gained 5%. Price Action: AVGO shares traded higher by 0.10% at $625.34 on the last check Wednesday.

118,2023-03-27T20:14:41+00:00,Charts: Three key readings to track financial market stress,"Stocks were mixed to start the week on Monday, though this action kept the Nasdaq Composite on pace for a quarterly gain north of 10% while the S&P 500 is up more than 3% to start the year.

Meanwhile, the Treasury market has also seen a huge rally with the 10-year yield falling from a high north of 4% in early March to as low as 3.38% last week.

These moves come as the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points last week and investors weigh the Fed's latest actions and attempt to assess the odds of further bank failures and even recession.

For investors looking tracking financial stress to watch going forward, here are the key charts to watch.

1. Rising Market Volatility — YF Tickers: ^VIX, ^VVIX, ^MOVE

The VIX (^VIX), also known as the ""fear index,"" measures investors' expectations of future (or ""implied"") volatility over the next 30 days in the S&P 500. It is calculated based on transactions in options on the index itself.

In general, higher stock index volatility tends to accompany selloffs, indicating ""fear"" in the market. Conversely, lower volatility is usually associated with stock market rallies

Just as the VIX measures stock market volatility, the VVIX (^VVIX) measures the volatility of the VIX itself. Sometimes, it will perk up and serve as an advance warning of moves in the underlying VIX.

The ICE BofAML MOVE Index (^MOVE) index is the bond market's answer to the VIX. It is calculated once each day after the close, and so unlike the VIX the MOVE Index does not give intraday readings of volatility.

Pro tip: An extreme upside VIX spike will usually accompany a huge down day in stocks — but that won't necessarily mark the low in stocks. If the VIX remains elevated, stocks can continue to drop as the VIX goes sideways, or even down itself. As the pros say, ""Don't confuse pace with direction.""

Current status: The VIX shot above the 30 level last week as concerns over bank stress grew — only to crash Monday and Tuesday last week and remain lower into the news week, trading near 21.

Story continues

The MOVE index peaked at nearly 200 on March 20 — higher than the pandemic highs — and after cooling mid-week, surged on Friday amid investor fears over Deutsche Bank (DB), finishing the week above 170.

2. Haven Flows — YF Tickers: JPY=X, EURJPY=X

Foreign exchange pairs measure the change in two currencies relative to one another. Typically, the ratio reflects differences in short-term interest rates between the two countries or areas.

Relatively higher-rate countries tend to attract investment capital, while lower-rate jurisdictions are sources of funds to be borrowed and invested elsewhere — generally referred to as the carry trade.

However, in times of stress, a premium is placed on developed market currencies — especially the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen. Money flows from risky areas into these safe havens in what are called ""haven flows.""

Over the last 30 years, the Bank of Japan has maintained the easiest monetary policy among developed nations. As a result, a favored macro trade is to borrow money in Japan, then invest it in the bonds of a higher-interest rate economy.

Traders have historically looked to the EURJPY pair — pitting the euro against the yen — as a barometer of global risk tolerance. If the euro rises against the yen, the theory says riskier investments are in favor as money flows into Europe from Japan. Conversely, the pair often heads south when global risk surfaces and funds need a relatively ""safe"" home.

Pitting the dollar against the yen is also useful to use as an early warning sign. With U.S. rates far above those in Japan, big flows into the yen — evidenced by a lower USDJPY — can be a red flag for overall risk tolerance when this pair drops quickly.

Pro tip: The order of the currencies in their abbreviated ticker is made by convention, which can be confusing. For instance, the euro versus the dollar is typically expressed as EURUSD. Notably, Yahoo Finance omits the ""USD"" in forex tickers if it occurs first and appends an ""=X"" to all pairs. For instance, the Yahoo Finance ticker for USDJPY is JPY=X, for EURJPY, the ticker is EURJPY=X.

Current status: Neither the euro nor the dollar is showing signs of sustained strong haven flows into the yen — though the yen has net strengthened since the SVB failure.

3. Deteriorating Credit Markets — YF Tickers:HYG, JNK

Investors closely watch corporate credit markets for signs of weakness, as they are often first to show cracks in risk appetite. Corporate bonds are measured in how wide or tight their rates of interest are from the corresponding tenors of government debt. But stock investors don't need a fancy terminal to measure stress in corporate bonds.

ETFs that track corporate credit — like the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (HYG) and the SPDR Bloomberg High Yield Bond ETF (JNK) — can do the job.

The ETFs track prices on a selection of corporate bonds, which move inversely to yield. In times of stress, when yields surge higher, the ETFs will nosedive, as they did during the pandemic and other periods of stress.

Back in the early days of the pandemic, the Fed took the then-unprecedented step to support corporate credit markets by buying these two ETFs directly.

If these ETFs do plummet again, watch out for quick, outsized reversals to the upside, which can indicate the Fed has taken action to support markets.

Current status: HYG and JNK aren't currently reflecting or forecasting extreme market stress.

119,2023-03-27T14:15:02+00:00,"Filling ETFs in March Madness ""Final Four"" Brackets","The 2023 National Collegiate Athletic Association (“NCAA”) Division I Men's Basketball Tournament kicked off on Mar 14 and is expected to continue for one more week. The champion will be crowned on Apr 3 at NRG Stadium in Houston, TX. The tournament works its way up from 64 college teams to ‘Sweet Sixteen’ on Mar 22 and then to ‘Elite Eight’ on Mar 26, followed by ‘Final Four’ and, ultimately, the championship.

The basketball frenzy spills over to the stock market, with various corners of the economy such as media, advertising, restaurants, hotels and airlines turning out to be the biggest beneficiaries. The excitement surrounding the tournament and its impact on the stock world has led investors to look at ETFs that could act as a proxy for the game. Since the tournament has reached Elite Eight, let’s start filling the brackets from this level (read: 5 ETFs to Make the Most of March Madness Betting).
 
Similar to the four-region criteria of the real championship, we have chosen four factors, namely equities, bonds, commodities, currencies. Then, we have shortlisted eight ETFs that are popular in the respective segments and fit our criteria. Fortunately, most of these funds has a Zacks ETF Rank making our seeding easier. In case of a tie between ranks or no ranks, we have considered the year-to-date performance in selecting the ETF qualifying for the next round.

Equities

SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) vs. Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) — After a strong start to the year, U.S. equities got caught in feeble trading over the past few weeks, triggered first by the Fed’s aggressive rate hike expectations and then the banking crisis. QQQ wins with a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy) compared with a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) for SPY.

Winner: QQQ

Bonds

iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) vs. SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 Month T-Bill ETF (BIL) – The treasury market is acting differently this year. While the banking crisis and the less hawkish Fed tone have compelled investors to flock to the Treasuries in recent weeks, the rounds of improving economic data are spurring confidence in the economy, raising the appeal for equities. BIL, with a Zacks ETF Rank #3, has an edge over TLT’s Zacks ETF Rank #4 (Sell) (read: Bank Scare, Uncertain Fed Raise Appeal for Cash-Like ETFs).

Winner: BIL

Story continues

Commodities

SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) vs. United States Oil Fund LP (USO) – Banking fears have raised the appeal for gold while leding to a sell-off in crude oil prices. The yellow metal hit $2000 per ounce for the first time in 2023 while oil prices crashed to multi-year lows. GLD wins, gaining 9.5% so far this year against a loss of 13% for USO.

Winner: GLD

Currencies

Invesco DB US Dollar Index Bullish Fund (UUP) vs. Invesco Currencyshares Japanese Yen Trust (FXY) – Both U.S. dollar and yen are regarded as safe haven currencies. The greenback is struggling to find its footing due to worries over the global financial system, while the yen is making its way higher lately. UUP is up 0.9% so far this year, while FXY has gained just 0.3%.

Winner: UUP

Final Four (Apr 1)

We come to the four teams in this playoff tournament and the best in their specific regions. Now, we look at the one-year performance to see who has the maximum momentum heading into the next level. In the matchups, we have QQQ versus BIL on one side and GLD versus UUP on the other.

QQQ versus BIL

For this ETF faceoff, let’s take a closer look at these funds before deciding on the winner:

QQQ - Invesco QQQ provides exposure to the 101 largest domestic and international non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq. Information technology accounts for 49.4% of the assets, while communication services and consumer discretionary make up for a 16.6% and 14.5% share, respectively.

Invesco QQQ is one of the largest and most-popular ETFs in the large-cap space, with AUM of $167 billion and an average daily volume of around 55.7 million shares. Invesco QQQ charges investors 20 bps in annual fees and has plunged 11.3% over the trailing one-year period.

BIL - SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 Month T-Bill ETF seeks to provide exposure to zero-coupon U.S. Treasury securities that have a remaining maturity of 1-3 months. It follows the Bloomberg 1-3 Month U.S. Treasury Bill Index, holding 19 securities in its basket. Both average maturity and adjusted duration come in at 0.10 years (read: Most Loved/Hated ETFs Amid the Height of Banking Crisis).

SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 Month T-Bill ETF has AUM of $29.8 billion and an average daily volume of 7.9 million shares. It charges 13 bps in annual fees and has gained 2.4% over the past year.

Winner: SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 Month T-Bill ETF wins and advances toward the final round to take on the winner of the GLD versus UUP match.

GLD versus UUP

Below, we take a closer look at these funds before picking the winner:

GLD - SPDR Gold Trust ETF tracks the price of gold bullion measured in U.S. dollars and kept in London under the custody of HSBC Bank USA. It is an ultra-popular gold ETF with AUM of $58 billion and a heavy volume of about 7 million shares a day. SPDR Gold Trust ETF charges 40 bps in fees per year from investors and has gained 9.5% in a year (read: Can Gold ETFs Continue Their Winning Run?).

UUP — Invesco DB US Dollar Index Bullish Fund is the prime beneficiary of a rising dollar as it offers exposure against a basket of six world currencies — euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, Swedish krona and Swiss franc. This is done by tracking the Deutsche Bank Long US Dollar Index Futures Index Excess Return plus the interest income from the fund’s holdings of U.S. Treasury securities.

Invesco DB US Dollar Index Bullish Fund has so far managed an asset base of $1.2 billion while seeing an average daily volume of around 3 million shares. It charges 77 bps in total fees and expenses and has gained 6.6% over the trailing one-year period.

Winner: SPDR Gold Trust ETF wins to compete with SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 Month T-Bill ETF for the championship.

The National Championship (Apr 3)

For the championship, let’s look at the performance of both ETFs over the past five years. GLD has gained nearly 47% compared with a 6% gain for BIL. This suggests that in the ETF world, SPDR Gold Trust ETF (GLD) will likely emerge as the winner of the 2023 March Madness championship based on our ranking system and its recent performance.

Friday, March 24, 2023

Today's newsletter is by Jared Blikre, a reporter focused on the markets on Yahoo Finance. Follow him on Twitter @SPYJared. Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App.

Stocks partially clawed back Wednesday's post-Fed losses on Thurday, with the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) notching a gain of of 1.0%, while the Russell 2000 (^RUT) settled in the red, down 0.4%.

On the one hand, investors are weighing Powell's hawkish, inflation-fighting comments. On the other, they're weighing signs that the Fed is de facto entering wait-and-see mode — believing its work is nearly done.

While Powell said the Fed may still have to raise rates further, he came clear saying the Committee was inches away from a no-hike decision on Wednesday.

""[W]e did consider [a pause] in the days running up to the meeting,"" he said.

This is the closest yet the Fed has come to a change in its uber-hawkish tone since it began its breakneck pace of rate hikes one year ago.

But don't call it a ""pivot,"" and don't sound the all-clear for investors just yet.

The major U.S. indices have been in rally mode since the Fed created a new liquidity facility a week ago last Monday to backstop regional banks. Tech stocks have been the biggest beneficiary, with the Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) up 7.6%. Nasdaq 100 Components — 9-Day Returns

Long-term rates crashed over these nine trading sessions, which fueled rallies in megacaps like Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Tesla (TSLA), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), and Meta (META) — which all rallied double-digits. Chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) led the way — up 19% and 23%, respectively.

Yet the rally was not broad-based. Not surprisingly, financials suffered additional damage from the bank panic. The S&P 500 Select Financial SPDR Fund (XLF) erased the last of its pandemic gains Thursday. Meanwhile, the SPDR S&P Regional Bank ETF (KRE) sank to a new crisis low — the lowest level since November 2020.

Story continues

Putting the narrow breadth of the latest rally aside for a minute, even the technicals on the tech trade are showing some cracks.

Zooming out on the Nasdaq 100 reveals it has been stuck in a giant trading range over the last year — roughly 10,500 to 13,000. And it is once again testing that upper bound, having failed there as recently as early February.

The catalyst of lower rates and a weaker dollar are also approaching some big levels, with the U.S. 10-year Treasury-note (^TNX) hugging the 3.4% level by the 2023 lows.

Even the greatest bellwether stock of all, Apple, is up against some tough technicals that suggest its rally may need a ""pause"" before rallying materially above $165. Apple (AAPL) has rallied to big, long-term levels of interest

Without a fresh catalyst and narrative, investors chasing momentum and breakouts are more likely to be punished than rewarded.

In the meantime, Kenneth Rogoff, Maurits C. Boas chair of International Economics at Harvard University, has a message for investors who are betting on the banking crisis abating.

""If we're looking at the world as a whole, I believe we're just experiencing the first wave of this, and there are more to come,"" said Rogoff on Yahoo Finance Live Thursday.

122,2023-03-22T19:15:00+00:00,Investors Bid Up Treasury ETFs After Quarter-Point Rate Hike,"Treasury exchange-traded funds jumped Wednesday after the ninth-straight interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve.

The central bank raised rates 25 basis points, less than what was expected a few weeks ago, after a series of bank collapses and rescues suggested a worrisome fragility to the U.S. and European banking sectors. The Fed at the beginning of the month was expected to raise rates by a half-percentage point as it sought to slash inflation from the current 6% to 2%.

The increase shows curbing inflation remains the Fed’s priority, according to Andrew Patterson, senior economist at Vanguard Group, the No. 2 ETF issuer.

“We agree with their assessment of the need to maintain focus on inflation with increase in rates combined with language acknowledging banking sector volatility and continued risk of inflation,” Patterson said in emailed comments to etf.com.

The hike brings the federal funds rate to between 4.75% to 5%, the highest level since 2007. Federal Open Market Committee participants reinforced their commitment to taming inflation to its 2% goal while acknowledging the effect of tightening on markets.

“Recent developments are likely to result in tighter credit conditions for households and businesses and to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation,” officials said in a statement. Still, they noted that rates may remain more elevated for longer than expected. Projections from FOMC officials show that the fed funds rate could reach 5.1% by the end of the year.

Broad bond ETFs, which have gained around 3% this year before the rate increase, moved higher on the news. The iShares 7-10 Year Treasury Bond ETF (IEF) rose around 1.3%, and the iShares U.S. Treasury Bond ETF (GOVT) and the Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND) both added one percent.

Stock ETFs declined after initially rallying. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) dropped 1.7% while the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) slipped 1.4%, in correspondence with their underlying indexes. Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year Treasury bill fell 15 basis points to 3.45%, while the policy-sensitive two-year note dipped 22 basis points to 3.96%. Bond yields fall as prices rise.

Story continues

In comments after the rate hike announcement, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated the U.S. banking sector is strong, while also suggesting the impact from collapses and bailouts remains to be seen.

“We are committed to learning lessons from this episode,” he said, adding that recent events in the banking system are “likely to result in tighter credit conditions,” but its future impact on the economy and monetary policy remain unclear.

Bank ETFs have been beaten down over the past four weeks: the $3.1 billion SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) is down 30%; the $1.3 billion SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE) lost 26% and the iShares U.S. Regional Banks ETF (IAT) dropped 32%.

Patterson said that it is “also clear that inflation remains the priority despite pain in the banking sector caused by higher rates based on statement language tweaks and forecast changes,” but maintained that there may be a recession in the second half of the year.

Before the rate hike, investors poured into both SPY and Treasury-linked ETFs. More than $10 billion went into SPY between March 13 and March 21. Meanwhile, IEF, GOVT and BIL hauled in $8.7 billion during the same period, according to etf.com data.

Magic Software (NASDAQ:MGIC) exceeded analyst expectations when it reported fourth-quarter 2022 results. MGIC stock fell when the technology supplier of centralized integrated platforms issued weak guidance.

In Q4, Magic Software posted revenue growing by 10.6% year over year to $147.1 million. Net income fell slightly because expenses rose. The firm increased sales and marketing expenses, related mostly to supporting its acquisition of TGG.

The TGG deal closed in the third quarter. It will add to revenue as demand for professional service experts climbs higher.

Magic Software’s over $500 million in annualized revenue is a catalyst. It is leveraging its digital technologies and cloud-based platforms. This creates a strong demand for its innovative solutions. Expect higher customer engagements to lift contract sizes. When the economy strengthens by then, Magic Software will increase its guidance.

B of A has several potential catalysts it could unleash from here. It could cut costs in advertorial themes that do not strengthen its brand. Last month, Bloomberg reported it cut up to 200 bank jobs globally. Markets will eventually react positively to the cut, setting B of A as one of the potential breakout stocks.

A panic over the safety of regional banks is driving deposits into B of A higher. When Silicon Valley Bank collapsed, the bank gained $15 billion in deposits.

The increased cash on hand improves the deposit/withdrawal ratio. Customers will have greater confidence in Bank of America’s deposit safety. This should lead to a favorable positive feedback loop that drives deposit amounts higher.

DXC Technology (NYSE:DXC) is an information technology services and consulting company.

The company enjoyed a buyout premium until it ended talks with a potential buyer. In a statement, it responded to a rumor that a potential buyer approached the firm on Oct. 4, 2022. The buyer could not complete the deal because of challenges in raising the capital.

In the third quarter of 2022, DXC posted revenue of $3.57 billion, down by 12.8% year over year. Investors sent DXC stock from around $29 to $22.92 recently. It posted those weak results plus it issued a fiscal 2024 revenue forecast of 0% to 1% in organic revenue growth.

A rebound in bookings and demand is a catalyst to classify DXC as one of the potential breakout stocks. The customer base is focused on achieving higher efficiency and lower costs. In addition, they need to invest in cyberattack protection, which lifts DXC’s revenue.

Chief Executive Officer Mike Salvino said that DXC offers a unique set of engineering skills. This will sustain its book-to-bill ratio and increase its growth in the longer term.

U.S. equity led the way higher with $7 billion in inflows, closely followed by $3.9 billion in U.S. fixed-income ETFs and $581 million in international fixed-income ETF, per etf.com.

As such, SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 Month T-Bill ETF BIL, iShares Core S&P 500 ETF IVV, iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF TLT and Invesco QQQ Trust QQQ dominated the top creation list last week.

The inflows came despite a rough week for stock markets. The Dow Jones wrapped its worst weekly performance since June, falling 4.4%. The S&P 500 dropped 4.5%, while the Nasdaq lost 4.7%. Wall Street took a huge beating following the biggest bank failure since the global financial crisis. The tech-focused lender Silicon Valley Bank shut down following losses in its bond portfolio, prompting the biggest bank failure since the global financial crisis and sending shockwaves not only through the banking sector but across the globe.

Additionally, rounds of strong economic data and the prevalent inflation have put a steeper-than-expected rate hike back on the table. Fed Chair Jerome Powell turned hawkish during his testimony to the Senate Banking Committee and opened the door to a half-point rate hike in March. The central bank would likely raise its key interest rate higher than anticipated and could resume larger hikes, citing a recent surge in job growth and inflation after slowing the pace in recent months (read: 4 Top Sector ETFs to Gain as Fed Signals Faster Rate Hikes).

The bank stocks turmoil overshadowed the February jobs report, which signals that inflation might be slowing. Though the U.S. economy added robust 311,000 jobs in February, the unemployment rate rose to 3.6% from 3.4%. Average hourly earnings rose 4.6% from a year ago, below the estimated 4.8%. The monthly increase of 0.2% was also below the 0.4% market expectations.

We have detailed the ETFs below:

SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY)

After stock markets fell last year, speculators tried to jumpstart 2023 with the hype around AI. Markets understand only half of the prospects in this emerging technology.

AI will disrupt industries and bring about change. AI needs heavy investments in training models, computing, power and hardware. Costs are more likely to grow faster than the revenue potential in AI.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Past fads like automation and machine learning are an extension of the AI hype train. After nearly a decade, neither of the former promises resulted in the promised growth.

Investors should sell the most overrated AI stocks in March.

AI C3.ai $22.05 NVDA Nvidia $231.48 PLTR Palantir Technologies $8.10

C3.ai (NYSE:AI) shows a troubling bearish “triple top” on its chart. The stock traded above $25 three times, only to fall each time. Last trading at around $21.30, it is among the AI stocks to sell after the government may introduce regulations. In the 14-page report, business lobbying groups voiced their concern about AI’s impact on national security and privacy.

C3.ai may need to spend more to appease the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

The company will need to rely on its current offering to show growth. It will post stronger service revenue. To support its gross revenue, it needs to keep its highly skilled workforce. However, investors may speculate that C3.ai would divert its professional services staff to answer to regulators.

In the last quarter, the company counted on a large service contribution from customers like Baker Hughes (NASDAQ:BKR).

It might increase its reliance on incremental bookings with Baker Hughes. C3.ai needs to broaden its customer base to report sustainable growth.

Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) sells AI operating systems that consume data to learn, trade, validate and for inference. The company convinced the market that it is the AI solution that will bring more machine learning efficiency at a great price.

Customers will buy Nvidia AI to train its model. Once completed, they may not need as much computing power in the next training cycle.

Nvidia may face more competition from AI solutions providers. Companies that pay for Nvidia’s AI computing architecture may look for alternatives. Nvidia has at least 10 alternatives for deep learning Amazon Machine Image.

Nvidia designs the full stack of its GPU and networking solution. It may need more time to develop new components. The company works with leaders in the field to meet those computationally intense and expensive needs. If customers delay or slow their AI investments, Nvidia will take longer to recoup its costs.

Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) touts its AI and machine learning models to provide insights for customers. However, its contract wins are rarely large in dollar size. It leaves its shareholders underwhelmed. Palantir is an AI stock to sell.

On Mar. 8, 2023, the Department of State announced a contract with Palantir worth $99.6 million over five years. The revenue of $20 million annually is not enough to offset its high costs. In the fourth quarter, Palantir earned only a penny a share. It disclosed a high total stock-based compensation of $129.4 million.

Palantir has some potential. It reported $508.6 million in revenue in Q4. This resulted in its first quarterly profit. The company expects to post a profit this year. Bears bet that the market will punish Palantir for its small profit. It stretches its stock to unfavorable valuation levels.

The stock market sentiment is getting worse. Last week, the S&P 500 (NYSE:SPY) lost 4.52% in value. These weak markets will probably pull PLTR stock multiples lower, hurting its share price.

128,2023-03-09T18:39:11+00:00,Construction jobs hold the key to understanding Friday's February jobs report,"On Friday morning the Bureau of Labor Statistics is expected to announce another strong jobs report, with economists expecting 225,000 jobs were added to the U.S. economy last month.

This report would build on January's blowout report that showed 517,000 jobs were created in the first month of the year.

Economists and investors alike will be looking for signs that the breakneck pace of Federal Reserve rate hikes is starting to slow the hottest labor market in five decades. Especially after Fed chair Jay Powell just doubled-down on his hawkish message to Congress that there remains a ways to go on the inflation-fighting front.

The bond market seems to believe Powell, ratcheting up expectations for the Fed to hike rates by 50 basis points instead of 25 basis points at its next meeting in under two weeks.

But Wall Street is clinging to its expectation that the unemployment rate holds steady at 3.4% — the lowest level since 1969 — without a hint of recession fears. Intelligent investors will be forgiven for asking — what gives?

Thomas Kennedy, J.P. Morgan Global Wealth Management chief investment strategist, joined Yahoo Finance Live on Thursday to break down expectations coming into the monthly jobs report.

Kennedy notes despite the housing slowdown, jobs are still relatively plentiful for the time being. However, that's about to change.

""In the housing sector, the slowdown has been the fastest we have ever seen. In development of new properties, completions of jobs are now higher than starts,"" he said. ""Imagine if you run a construction business. If you complete ten jobs, you only start eight. There's a team that needs to be laid off."" In this Wednesday, May 23, 2012, file photo, a new home still under construction is seen for sale in Springfield, Ill. (AP Photo/Seth Perlman, File)

Historically, construction jobs are the canary in the coal mine in the U.S. labor market.

Over the last 11 recessions going back seven decades, growth in construction jobs has turned negative — meaning job losses have appeared in the sector — one month into the recession.

Story continues Construction jobs have often been a leading indicator as the U.S. economy tips into recession.

On average, construction job losses lead overall job losses by nearly half a year, though there are exceptions. After the dot-com bust in 2001, total U.S. payrolls finally turned negative five months into the 2001 recession. Construction flipped three months later.

Ironically, any negative surprises in the labor market stats revealed Friday will probably be a boon for stocks, as investors will likely view any weakness as a necessary prelude to an eventual Fed pivot.

Indeed, the weekly jobless claims report from the Department of Labor Thursday morning showed 211,000 initial jobless claims filed — more than the 195,000 expected by the Street.

Stock futures rallied strongly on the weaker-than-expected numbers.

Friday morning should be no different. Bad is good, and good is bad — at least for a while.

Fed chair Jay Powell just poured cold water on the ""no landing"" crowd hoping to avert a U.S. recession and rally stocks to fresh record highs this year.

After two days of grilling before Congress, investors have been reminded (again) that the Fed chief still sees inflation as a persistent, pernicious threat.

Stocks and bonds took notice Wednesday, as both sold off amid surging short-term rates — leaving the major indices underwater for the week as of the close.

""If the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes,"" said Powell before the Senate.

And with two weeks to go until the next Fed meeting, markets are now expecting exactly that. Bonds and derivatives are pricing in a more hawkish outcome — expecting the Fed to lift its benchmark rate 50 basis points instead of 25 basis points.

Since Monday's settlement, the U.S. 2-year Treasury-Note yield has surged 18 basis points to 5.06% — the highest level since 2007. It also deepened its inversion over the 10-year yield, with the spread reaching negative 108 basis points (or -1.08 percentage points) — the highest since the early 1980s when Paul Volcker was the Fed chair fighting a similar battle over price inflation.

Under normal conditions, interest rates of longer-term loans or bonds (the cost of money) are expected to be more expensive than their shorter-term counterparts, as risk is higher on the long end. But this changes when the Fed starts stamping out animal spirits, lifting short-term rates to restrict the creation of credit and eventually choke off growth.

Story continues

While the magnitude, or depth, of a yield curve inversion isn't necessarily predictive of a deeper, or longer recession, there are a host of other indicators in the bond market that are sounding alarm bells.

Former bond trader and CEO of TheMacroCompass.com Alfonso Peccatiello recently joined Yahoo Finance Live to offer his insights.

Peccatiello notes that the bond market expects the Fed to fight inflation and remain tight, with interest rates well over 5% a year from now. ""That cannot happen if a recession is unfolding. The Federal Reserve will be forced to cut interest rates,"" he said. Source: TheMacroCompass.com

Essentially, the inflation-fighting credibility that Powell has earned in the markets comes with a cost — pushing expectations of Fed capitulation far beyond what occurs historically.

""The issue is — the tighter you keep borrowing conditions for the private sector, the higher you keep mortgage rates, the higher you keep corporate borrowing rates — the higher the chances you're going to freeze these credit markets and basically sleepwalk into an accident or, in general, accelerate a recession later on,"" said Peccatiello.

But long before the Fed delivers relief in the form of cuts, Peccatiello expects stocks to suffer from an earnings recession, which, he says, ""isn't fully priced in."" (An earnings recession — marked by two consecutive quarterly declines in S&P 500 earnings — often, but not always precedes an economic recession.)

Peccatiello believes the U.S. is already in an earnings recession, with stocks reflecting complacency. Nevertheless, he doesn't expect a disaster. He sees about 10% maximum downside risk in the S&P 500 down to the 3600 level, which is right around last year's lows.

""I don't think it's going to be much lower than that,"" he says, adding, ""[T]he stock market generally bottoms before earnings bottom."" The reason gets back to the Fed, which historically capitulates and slashes rates as earnings drop.

The Fed rate cuts then get incorporated into better stock valuations, which eventually halt the decline in stock prices, Peccatiello added. ""[This] means the stock market can stop its decline and start slowly but surely moving into a new bull market.""

Dr. Rhoiney, a renowned robotic surgeon and financial literacy enthusiast, has pointed out that many Americans are ""locked out of financial advice,"" and this is a concerning trend that needs to be addressed.

Dr. Rhoiney believes that financial literacy is an essential tool for building financial stability and security. Unfortunately, many Americans -- even the wealthy -- lack access to the kind of financial advice and education that can help them achieve their goals. This can be due to a lack of resources, geographical constraints, or simply not knowing where to turn for help.

One of the most significant challenges facing many Americans is the rising cost of financial advice. Many financial advisors charge high fees that can be prohibitive for those who are struggling to make ends meet. This can create a vicious cycle in which individuals are unable to access the financial advice they need to improve their financial situation.

Dr. Rhoiney believes that addressing this problem requires a multi-faceted approach. First and foremost, there needs to be more education and outreach to help individuals understand the importance of financial literacy. This can include initiatives at the community level, such as financial literacy classes or workshops, as well as national campaigns to raise awareness about the issue.

Another key strategy is to provide more affordable financial advice. Dr. Rhoiney suggests that there needs to be greater competition in the financial advice industry to drive down costs and make advice more accessible. Additionally, there are emerging technologies, such as robo-advisors, that can provide low-cost financial advice to individuals who might not otherwise be able to afford it. However, such services are in their infnacy and are not robust.

Beware Of Bad Advice From Financial Advisors – Forbes Advisor

It is the average price for the day, weighted by volume, with each share traded getting equal weight. The cumulative average builds throughout the day, and if more volume comes in on an up move, the VWAP will rise, but if more volume comes in as the market moves lower, the VWAP will decline, and prices will be below it.

According to veteran trader and alphatrends.net founder Brian Shannon, CMT, we can determine with 100% accuracy who has control at the beginning of the day based on where the VWAP is in relation to it.

When thinking about support and resistance levels, traders use the word ""porosity,"" which is similar to drawing a trendline with a crayon instead of a straight edge, where the VWAP becomes a battleground in that area. He calls them levels of interest rather than levels of resistance. The anchored VWAP initiated from the all-time high for the NASDAQ, for instance. It measures sentiments with precision and tells us that from that top, the average long participant is losing money because the price is lower than the average, while the average short seller is making money.

Shannon advises that as the market comes up to the anchored VWAP, not only will long people be looking to break even, but short sellers might put a big offer on there and try to scare the long holders out of it. He sees it as a transition of a balance of power, and if buyers are able to wrestle away control and take control of the trend, prices can re-emerge in a new uptrend supported by the average participant being in a profitable position and the average short seller scrambling to cover their losses.

Shannon advises looking at the shorter-term timeframe for trend alignment and measuring sentiment and psychology to determine who is in control from a particular event. He suggests measuring VWAP from an event and looking for the first couple of days or two, where buyers gain control, and then a battle ensues where sellers regain control. By analyzing the sentiment and psychology, traders can determine whether the buyers or sellers have regained control and make informed trading decisions.

JARED BLIKRE: Welcome to another episode of ""Yahoo Finance Uncut."" I am your host, Jared Blikre. Today, joining me is a veteran trader. I learned a lot from him over the years. He is the founder of AlphaTrends.net. It is Brian Shannon. And Brian, you are also the author of a new-- a brand new book about anchored VWAP called ""Maximum Trading Gains with Anchored VWAP, The Perfect Combination of Price, Time, and Volume.""

We're going to be getting into that in a minute. But I just want to get into your general overview. I like to ask guests-- we are in the middle of February, or actually we're towards the end of February right now. This probably a taped presentation for most listeners. But we're going to keep it very relevant to what's been happening.

We had earlier this week the worst day of the year. We've seen Fed hawkishness in view kind of rear its ugly head again. And we're not going to spend too much on fundamentals here. We're going to deal with the technicals. But, Brian, what are you seeing in the markets right now?

BRIAN SHANNON: Jared, I think that, you know, 2022 obviously was a bad bear market. And people are still kind of licking their wounds from that. I've said from the beginning of the year I kind of think that theme for this year is if they didn't scare you out last year, they're likely to wear you out.

Now, it's not a call for a neutral market necessarily, but I think that we're still going to need some time to digest those losses. You know, we've still got bad inflation numbers today. And, you know, I think there's still a lot of uncertainty that people aren't willing to commit in a major way.

So the good news about that is though it creates a good trading environment, and in particular, for individual stocks. The problem-- the flipside is not a lot of stuff is following through. So, to me, it's an environment where we're still in a heightened sense of defensiveness, and we've got to just trade a little bit smaller, and have lower expectations, and hope that we get pleasantly surprised.

JARED BLIKRE: All right, we're going to get into some tickers in a minute-- in a minute here, but I want to get to the subject, the heart of the matter here, why we're here, your book on anchored ""VWEP."" And as you pronounce it, VWAP. Brian, we've talked about this over the years. I never got used to the VWAP. And I down at the floor at the New York Stock Exchange, a lot of guys down there they say, ""VWOP,""-- ""VWEP,"" excuse me. I'm still stuck in my ways here. So forgive any confusion about that ahead of time.

But just tell me what the premise is behind VWAP and then how you've morphed this use case into something a lot more generalized and powerful.

BRIAN SHANNON: Right, so, first of all, I didn't invent it. I-- something I stumbled upon really back in 2003, and there was really very little information about it. So what I found out was, first of all, what is VWAP, the Volume Weighted Average Price. The Volume Weighted Average Price was invented in 1988 as a benchmark for institutions to determine whether or not they got a good execution on an order.

So it's the average price over the course of one day, weighted by the volume. So each single share traded gets an equal weighting. It's a cumulative average that builds throughout the day.

So if more volume is coming in on the up move, then the Volume Weighted Average Price will be rising. If more volume is coming in as the market moves lower, then the Volume Weighted Average Price will be declining and prices will be below it. And we can tell with 100% accuracy who has control from the beginning of the day based on where it is in relation to it.

The way that most people can really think about it, Jared, is the Volume Weighted Average Price is basically a dollar cost average, where if you put a certain number of dollars into a particular stock every single month, well some-- some months if the stock is $20 per share, you're going to buy 50 shares. If the stock is $50, you're going to buy 20 shares.

Because that's dollar cost averaging. It's your Volume Weighted Average Price at the end of the year. And it's similar for The daily Volume Weighted Average Price.

JARED BLIKRE: And Brian, I have a chart that I prepared-- or actually, I've copied off of you, as you prepared this chart. It's of the NASDAQ 100 Index. And you have anchored ""VWEP,"" or VWAP, from the all-time high here, it looks like in mid-November of 2021. And you can see it capturing the price here. Not-- not perfectly-- I think as investors were used to dealing with a certain amount of porosity when it comes to indicators. But very, very closely it captured all of these pullbacks.

And the way I like to think about this, Brian, because I've been using this tool a long time alongside you-- you've actually expanded the use cases for me, and we can get into that later. What I like to think about it is, it is the average price at which a person-- the average investor has gotten into the market since a period of time. And so you can tell, are they winning or are they losing?

And right now, because they're under this red line right here, the average investor is underweight. And then a very powerful signal here. When we get back up to that red line, you can think of the average position as break even.

Well, what do a lot of people do when they reach break even after sitting on losses for a long period of time? A lot of people are just going to go ahead and sell, to be able to say, oh, I got out with a small profit and didn't incur that loss. So I think in there comes some of the predictive power why we see these reactions off of the line. Just like to get your reaction to my little explanation there and then what you're seeing in this chart.

BRIAN SHANNON: Yeah, so a couple of things to unpack there. One, the anchored Volume Weighted Average Price is simply we chose a starting point other than the beginning of the day. In this case, the all-time high for the NASDAQ. And what it allows us to do is measure sentiment. It's really the ultimate sentiment indicator.

Because when we think of sentiment, we think of the investors polls that say, hey, I'm bullish or bearish. But it doesn't mean, that's what they're doing with their money. This tells us with precision that the average participant in the NASDAQ 100-- from that top, the average long participant is losing money because the price is higher. The average price is higher.

The average short seller-- you can't forget about them-- is making money. So they're-- maybe as the market comes up to that anchor VWAP, not only do you have long people looking to break even, but you might have the short sellers putting a big offer on there and trying to scare the long holders out of it.

So a word that you mentioned was one that was actually coined by Dr. Levine, Paul Levine, who invented the anchored VWAP, and that was porosity. And what he said-- it's kind of similar to what I learned from Larry McMillan, that you draw a trend line with a crayon instead of a straight edge and a pencil. But you want to-- you're going to expect there's a-- it becomes a battleground in that area.

So I don't always call them a level of resistance when we get to them. I call them a level of interest, where we want to see how that battle unfolds, and whether the sellers maintain that control, or if the buyers are able to wrestle away the control, take-- take control of the trend and prices then can reemerge in a new uptrend that's supported by the average participant being in a profitable position, and the average short seller scrambling to cover their losses maybe.

JARED BLIKRE: Very good explanation. I want to look at a different chart here. Let's go to something you brought to my interest, Dynatrace, ticker DT. And this is a longer term look. This goes back to its October high-- I believe all-time high of 2021, so similar time period as the NASDAQ. And then we can drill down into an intraday time frame and look at some other things.

But when I look at this longer term chart, goes back a couple of years, it reminds me of the NASDAQ, what we were just looking at, in a certain way, except we've broken above this critical threshold right here, the red line, the potential resistance. Now maybe potentials for support, definitely a level of interest, I would say.

BRIAN SHANNON: Definitely level of interest. And, Jared, the thing here is the stock peaked at about 80. Nobody knew it was the high at that point.

But, you know, after it broke down to about 65, 70, we can look at that and say, you know what, that was an important high. That's when we set that anchor. Because we realized that was an important high. So we want to start to measure sentiment against that.

And as the stock drops over the next six months, down to as low as $30 per share, that was the vicious part of the bear market. That was the part where they scared people out. Then from about May of last year, up til just the beginning of February, they wore people out.

It's the transition of balance of power that the buyer-- the V bottoms, they seem like they occur. So it seemed like a V bottom in May, but there was no follow through there. Now we have a much more solid base here that the prior resistance seems to be holding the support, the stock was up on big volume a couple of weeks ago related to an earnings report. So we want to say the sentiment shifted there.

There was a big disruption in the supply and demand, which caused that gap on big volume. So that's when we take a look at the shorter-term time frame to look for trend alignment, which, of course, was the first book I wrote.

So in here, you've got-- it looks like a 15-minute, maybe a 10-minute--

JARED BLIKRE: Yes.

BRIAN SHANNON: -time frame. So that first red, or the second anchored VWAP is anchored to that event. And what you want to do is measure the sentiment, the psychology-- who's in control from a particular event.

And what we'd often see is, you know, the buyers were gaining control that first couple of days or two. And then we'll start to see that battle. And now the sellers have regained control in here for now. And it's below that anchorage Volume Weighted Average Price from the earnings.

That tells me with 100% certainty the average long participant who bought after earnings, the average is losing money. Because the average price is $44.46. And here we are at $42.85.

It's not a huge loss, but it tells me I don't want to buy yet. I want to buy when the buyers regain control of that shorter-term trend and put it in alignment with that bigger picture trend, especially when we're in this shaky environment.

The blue line that it's interestingly holding, that's the year-to-date anchored Volume Weighted Average Price.

JARED BLIKRE: Yes.

BRIAN SHANNON: And that is always a measurement that you want to keep an eye on because that's how institutions are often benchmarked for their performance. And what you can see is this stock is tightening up. It's pinching in that-- in between those two anchored Volume Weighted Average Price levels.

So as the range gets tighter, we'd want to see some higher lows. And then if it can break above that prior high, at about $45 per share, that tells me the buyers will be in control. And then my worst-case stop would go underneath the recent low, just underneath the-- the previous one back, right there.

Because if we buy the short-term higher high in anticipation that it's going to be in alignment with the bigger picture time frame, well, I don't want to set my stop 7% away, 8% away, 4% away. I want to base my stop on the definition of trend. The definition of uptrend is higher highs and higher lows.

So if I buy that higher high above the flat horizon anchored Volume Weighted Average Price, my stop would go underneath the most recent and relevant higher low. That would be right there. So if it breaks back down, the definition of trend is no longer existent. I have no reason to continue to hold the stock.

JARED BLIKRE: Very important things that you're going over here. And I just want to spend a little bit more time on risk management since you're talking about stocks. Anchor VWAP a way-- just a way to formulate your risk management-- your risk management, I guess, plan here. But this is something that pervades your thought process with respect to trades, whatever-- whatever you're using right here.

And why don't you go over it? I mean, you've written about this and talked about this for years, but some of the basics is if you know where your general entry is, and you can place a stop, well, then you can calculate potential risk-reward. I don't believe you're necessarily into that because you're not about price targets as much.

But you do have-- you are able to define your risk going into the trade in absence of a huge stop blowout, gapped down to the downside, which I guess does happen. You're going to be a lot better off than somebody who's just sitting on their hands and hoping for the best.

BRIAN SHANNON: Yeah, and so a couple of things you said there, Jared. One, as far as price targets go, you're right, I don't like a price target. I think that people get hung up on a price target. I think it forms an anchor in your mind. And that's what the anchored Volume Weighted Average Price is all about, about Daniel Kahneman's work about the investors biases, the heuristics. And one of those is the anchoring bias.

We're anchored to the price that we pay. Then we become anchored to-- because that's-- that's our most important price. We measure success or failure based on that. So what I want to do is not set this price target in my mind that it's going to go to $50 per share. I can't sell until it gets there. And I'm going to keep my stop where it is.

People say the winners take care of themselves, and I don't believe that. I think you have to manage your trade once you're in it, and continue to raise your stops up underneath the most recent relevant higher low, as it makes those higher lows, and listen to the message of the market when you get out.

It's a great idea, though, of course, to have a general idea where the stock can go. And since we don't see much resistance here in this time frame, we'd have to flip back to the daily time frame and say, what looks reasonable here?

Does it look reasonable that it can make it up to $50 per share? Is there any prior big resistance in there? That looks like a reasonable-- not expectation, but a reasonable place where it could run up to.

So if we buy it at $44, we're looking forward to go up to $50, that's approximately six points of upside. And if we have our stop at $42.50, then we're risking 1 and 1/2 points. So that would be a really nice risk-reward. That would be a $1-- a $1.5 risk for 6 points of upside. That's a 1 to 4 risk-reward ratio, which is a great risk-reward ratio.

But the danger, again, with price targets, and price objectives, I like to call them, is they're garbage in, garbage out. They're only as good as are you looking at the right things? Does the market agree with you? So to me, I look at it and say, it has a reasonable chance of getting there. But my job is to manage risk, not just get focused on that abstract number.

JARED BLIKRE: That's a really good point. And just thinking about risk management and trading in general, one of the things I've been talking about recently with a number of traders is the percentage of wins is actually fairly low for most momentum traders, looking at a win percentage of maybe 1 in 3. And it can go as low as 1 in 4. It can be as high as 50%.

But these momentum traders are just looking to follow the trend. They're not trying to catch the falling knife or the huge inflections in the market. And I'm just wondering what your thoughts on your approach to trading.

Because it gets back to the tendency that I was talking about before, which is traders see, OK, I've been down in this trade for a while. I get back to a little bit of green. Now I can hit the exit button. There are some powerful things to unpack there. Just wondering what your-- what you see.

BRIAN SHANNON: Well, you know, it's all about psychology always. And I'm not sure I got the full question, what it was there, Jared, but where I'm going to go with this is that it depends on time frames as well. You're talking about momentum traders and maybe 1 in 3, for instance. And the whole idea is that's just the simple math.

If I make money one time, and I make $5, or $6, let's say in this trade, but I lose two, three, four other times, and I lose $1 each one of those times. I don't want to lose, but the math adds up that if I lose $1 three times in a row, but I make $6 1 out of 4, well, then my risk-reward-- my one winner covers those losers, which is why it's so important to go back to the basic principles of trading, hold your winners and cut your losers.

But have a strategy based on realistic analysis and honest to your time frame. If it's a swing trade, day trade, or even investment, that these anchored Volume Weighted Average Price levels will give us an opportunity to just formulate a much stronger plan.

JARED BLIKRE: Great advice. And we're going to get back to some tickers and some charts in a second. Just want to take a moment to, I guess, talk about how you came into what you call your discovery of VWAP and anchor VWAP here, excuse me. Some of the methodology, and just your background in terms of how you came to view the markets as you do.

You're a very well-respected trader. You've given freely of your time. You also charge for services, of course. But I learned about you years ago. And I've seen you on Twitter just really be generous with your analysis, putting a lot of free stuff out there. And so just tell us a little bit about your journey, going back to your roots in trading.

BRIAN SHANNON: Yeah, well, you know, I've-- I like to help people on Twitter. And I've got a-- an easy way of explaining things, I think, that a lot of people-- you know, I-- I started as a retail stockbroker in Boston. And I remember, you know, not-- actually, it wasn't at Lehman Brothers, but a small firm before that.

The manager said, you know, your customers are like mushrooms. Feed them [BLEEP] and keep them in the dark. And I was like that doesn't make sense. Why don't we just explain what's going on here and earn their trust? Why do we want to do that to them?

So I started out as a retail broker in 1991. I was immediately fascinated with trading. The first book I devoured was Stan Weinstein's book, his classic, ""Secrets for Profiting in Bull and Bear Markets."" Then I read, you know, just every technical analysis book I could get a hold of. And I went through the same process that everyone does.

You know, I started looking for head and shoulders patterns. I looked for cups and handles. I looked for stochastic crossovers and MAC-D, and RSI, and moon phases, and every single indicator and oscillator you can think of. You know, I've looked at them. And a lot of them are really good. They can help point you in the right direction.

But when it came to the Volume Weighted Average Price, and in particular the anchored Volume Weighted Average Price-- it was about 2003, I was trading on a platform called Real Tick. And Real Tick had the daily Volume Weighted Average Price. And I would look at that, and, you know, no one was talking about this. I couldn't find any information. I mean, the search engines barely worked back then, right?

JARED BLIKRE: Right.

BRIAN SHANNON: You know, that was 20 years ago. So I started noticing, hey, you know what, it pulls back and find support there often. So then I would change-- I kind of hacked-- I mean, it wasn't really much of a hack, but I left that VWAP on there.

And I would-- instead of looking at one day, where it was meant to be looked at, I would look at five days, 10 days. And I would say it gapped higher four days ago. And I would-- so I'd look at four days. And I'd just be astounded by how the stock would be supported at this Volume Weighted Average Price level.

So I tried to find as much information as I could about it. I just, you know, continued to be curious. I wrote my first article about it in 2008. And then it was in 2015 that TC2000 made it really accessible to the-- to the public, which is they were the first ones to do a point and click anchor so I could anchor from any point on the chart.

Yahoo Finance's EU followed suit about two years after that. And I believe, Jared, that was-- was that four years ago or so?

JARED BLIKRE: That seems a long time ago. I remember you telling me about this book when you were in our studio in 2016 or 2017. So the time period sounds about right. I had a conversation with our head of product, Charlie Hartel afterwards. I'll give him a shout out on Twitter. And he was the one who was generous enough to allocate some of the engineers time and programmers' time to implement this in Yahoo Finance.

BRIAN SHANNON: Yeah, exactly. So it's there for free in Yahoo Finance, which is an amazing resources. If people aren't familiar, go to the Yahoo Finance charts and look for that anchored VWAP icon. And Jared's pulling it up right here. And set your anchors. And it's just the same as the other tools. In fact, some sophisticated tools don't have-- platforms don't have it.

But, you know, it's become mainstream. A large part, I think, due to my efforts of just non-stop talking about it for the last 15 years on Twitter. And finally, I've written this book so I can share my experience and knowledge, and help other people learn from what I've learned the hard way, the School of Hard Knocks.

And you know, their learning curve can just drastically be reduced. And you get to see the truth of the market, which is-- you know, it's the best measurement of supply and demand there is. I've looked at them all. It the only one that is the true, 100% measure of supply and demand from any point on the chart.

JARED BLIKRE: Yeah, I got to agree here. In terms of indicators, and there's thousands of them-- there's probably 100 on Yahoo Finance alone-- this is probably one of the best that I've seen there. And it's always in my arsenal. If I'm taking a look at a market, always got the year to date, and then I'll plug them in on gaps.

And just-- I'm going to take a second here. Here, since we have this up, I'm going to show you something we can do. We actually have some enhanced functionality. We can plot the-- and I think you go over this in your book-- the standard deviation lines. And we can even put in some shading there. It looks like I got a--

BRIAN SHANNON: Nice.

JARED BLIKRE: Yeah, so if we click out of this, you can see the second standard deviation line catching a lot of the downtrend here. And that also tells me the strength of the downtrend. So whether you're hitting that first standard deviation band, the second, and the third, that's something to potentially look at. So there's a lot-- there are a lot of variations on this.

I came on to anchored VWAP as it was presented in the mid-90s. You mentioned Paul Levine, he had this entire Midas method. But then he died in the late '90s, a few years after he formulated this. And it just kind of lost way. And then about the same time, I was in this group, I think somebody else in the group discovered you.

And then you were using anchor VWAP with great success, as well as some other things. We were looking at Weinstein stages. This was in the wake of the global financial crisis, lots going on. But that was-- that was my first exposure to you. Although, I don't think we had any direct communication back then.

BRIAN SHANNON: No, I remember that group. It was--

JARED BLIKRE: Effective Volume.

BRIAN SHANNON: [INAUDIBLE] ran it. What was it?

JARED BLIKRE: EffectiveVolume.eu.

BRIAN SHANNON: Effective-- yeah, exactly, yeah. So anyways, you could look at this chart too, Jared, and there's our new price target. It's $63.03. Because it worked on the down side, it must work on the upside, right? And I'm teasing there, and I'm doing it to make a point. That there's a lot of ways to misuse a tool like this as well.

You know, I've seen people say, Brian, I bought the stock at $30 per share so I set an anchor there. And it doesn't seem to really give me much value here. And the reason that the anchored Volume Weighted Average Price is supported or finds resistance is from key levels, where there's a lot of price memory in the market. It's not about you or me. Because the market doesn't care about where I bought the stock.

So for me to put an anchored VWAP on my price, it doesn't mean anything. We have to go to, OK, the earnings report. That caused a big supply and demand shift. And, for instance, on Meta-- oh, I'm sorry, we're not looking at that chart. So it caused a big supply and demand shift.

And we want to look at where that imbalance-- you know, where there might become an imbalance and a potential turn in the price of the action or where the stock will pull back and find buyers at that anchor Volume Weighted Average Price from the earnings report. That tells us, you know, there's big committed buyers who are looking to pay that average price because they're accumulating a large number of shares.

JARED BLIKRE: Yes, and let's continue to another example. I have Meta here up on the screen, anchoring from the all-time high in late 2021. That's when that peaked out. And we saw these-- some huge disastrous earnings gaps here. I think both of these-- or at least there were a couple that were 25%. And this is just a monster one, from 300 to below 250.

And then we had this other one towards the bottom end of the trading range here. You've set an anchored VWAP-- this is in your charts to me, which I have reproduced here. And we have a potential another squeeze going on here. What do you see in the chart?

BRIAN SHANNON: Yeah, we do have a squeeze or a pinch. I think, actually, Levine called it a squeeze. But what we're seeing here is-- you know when we see a pinch developing, what I really want to see is a real tight compression of energy. And here, you know, the bottom is 126. The high is 196. I'd like to see it drop down to 126, then see that VWAP off the peak come down and meet it at 180, in just kind of a triangle form where it starts to balance out.

But what we saw-- and the reason I wanted to point this out is that that last earnings report, they had some good news in that report, and the stock gapped way up. Well, the stock gapped up. And that day, I pointed out on Twitter-- I said, here we are at the anchored VWAP from the all-time high, after the stock has just doubled in the last six months.

So you have to ask yourself-- you know, when you look at the news, don't-- you know, don't feel that FOMO, and say, hey, the news is great, the stock is on fire, I got to get involved. Instead, you know, ask yourself, where has the stock come from? It just came from $95 a share up to $195, in a short period of time. Where does it have the potential to go before it's likely to find a source of supply that might become resistance? What's that level of interest?

Well, that level of interest was the anchored VWAP off the all-time high. And I said, you know, the risk-reward is terrible here. Don't-- don't be a buyer. And I wasn't expecting it to just fall apart from there. But we've seen, you know, close to a 30-point drop, you know, 15%, uninterrupted. And there's no demand, equilibrium in there yet.

So they give us great levels to say where is that risk-reward, as well as support and resistance, and what might be a reasonable way that the stock might act as certain events unfold?

JARED BLIKRE: Yes. And just to broaden the discussion out, I don't want to throw all other indicators under the bus here. Something that I use is RSI, just because of its simplicity, relative strength indicator. It got overbought and oversold. This actually became just slightly overbought. Looks like the RSI got up to the 80s there as it was approaching this level.

So standard technical analysis, when you have a momentum indicator with overbought and oversold is when you approach overbought into resistance, that's a potential stopping point. And oversold into a key level, that's potential support.

Wondering do you use any other indicators like this? Are just using bar charts to read the price action? And I kind of know the answer to this, but maybe just tell us a little bit about the rest of your methodology.

BRIAN SHANNON: Yeah, great question, Jared. And, you know, if anyone finds value in the relative strength or the MAC-D or the Adam's pitchfork. I always tell people-- you know, they say, well, Brian, should I replace the Apple App with all of these? , No of course not. If you found those to be useful, add the anchored Volume Weighted Average Price to complement the work you're doing and see if it does fit for you.

It's not-- you know, not everyone's going to think it's the best thing since sliced bread the way I do. But to me, it is the best one. It's not what I use exclusively. So the Volume Weighted Average Price, as we know, is constructed of the three most important components in the market-- price, only price pays, volume, it gives us the emotional intensity level, you know, commitment of the market participants, and then time.

And time is a subjective fact. Where do we measure our time frame? Is it-- you know, is it basically swing trader? I'm in the market for a few days to maybe a couple weeks. Warren Buffett, obviously, you know, thinks that what I do is insane. What I think-- what he does, I think he's nuts, especially at his age. He should be day trading.

So anyways, the point, though, Jared is, that time, again, being the most subjective, I do use simple moving averages as well, just as kind of a trend tool to kind of help-- you know, and the point of a moving average is to smooth out price trends.

JARED BLIKRE: Yeah.

BRIAN SHANNON: So we can kind of see, you know, where the-- where the-- you know, a cleaner look of the trend. The interesting thing about it is that, you know, the simple moving averages or exponential, whatever you use, it doesn't really matter, the reason that they're used is kind of interesting.

In that we-- you know, most people look at a 50-day moving average, or they look at a 200-day moving average. And, you know, I've done little surveys of groups of people, and said, well, why do you use the 50-day moving average? And they just kind of look around, and, you know, well, that's what I was taught. That's what everyone does.

And that's the interesting thing about technical analysis as well, is that there is a self-- not fulfilling necessarily, but a self-reinforcing component to these indicators and oscillators that comes back to them. But it's based on the psychology of supply and demand. If enough people view the 50-day moving average as a potential support level, well, they'll stop selling their stock as it gets to that level. They'll start to put in bids at that level. Short sellers will stop selling and maybe start to cover.

So all of that underneath the surface is occurring for a psychological reason. Hey, there's typically support at the 50. Well, all those actions, based on different market participants-- long, short, longer-term, shorter-term participants, all around this moving average that people have agreed. You know, it's like the-- history is in an accepted-- what is it-- a collection of lies.

So this is-- this isn't-- this is, you know, an accepted soon to be average that people are looking at to say, let's see how it is compared to that price from that time. And there's nothing wrong with that. I still use it.

But what's more accurate is, now I want to know what's the anchored Volume Weighted Average Price since that earnings report when it touched the anchored VWAP from the all-time high? Because the sellers are in control from there. And as long as it's below the-- that anchored VWAP, well, then I know I don't want to be a buyer because the sellers are still in control, and the shorts are probably still trying to push it down. Maybe they'll close that gap, or whatever it is.

But it's a marriage of traditional support and resistance, even cups and handles, if that's your thing, and stage analysis-- you know, Weinstein, Wyckoff, classic Stage 1, accumulation, Stage 2, markup, Stage 3, distribution, and Stage 4, decline. And then moving them together on multiple time frames for the-- for really good timing, basically.

JARED BLIKRE: Love all this discussion. Getting a little bit wonky here, and that's perfectly fine. That's what we're here to do on ""Yahoo Finance Uncut."" Want to get your reaction-- I'm interested in what you've seen evolve over the last few years with respect to the retail trader.

We've discussed this a few times before. And the retail trader has been-- if you just started with your stimulus checks in 2020 or early 2021, and you're still around, congratulations to you. Because a lot of traders have been flushed-- and some who have been trading for decades have not done that well. And I'm wondering what kind of questions are you getting now? What's the journey like for newer traders as they're trying to navigate these markets?

BRIAN SHANNON: Well, I think, Jared, that the people who got the stimulus tap right as the market rallied. And, you know, you could see the inexperience of these people, and the emotion that they had, and all their gains, and that. And it was just a recipe for disaster. And, unfortunately, ended the way a lot of market professionals thought it would.

But it doesn't mean that all the professionals did great. I mean, they successfully destroyed Gabe Plotkin and his hedge fund. So, you know, there's-- there's retail money, there's institutional money, and then there's smart money The institutional money doesn't mean smart money. We've seen all kinds of big money do dumb things with their money.

And there's those experienced people who have been around for a while, through a few market cycles. And the thing that keeps them there is that they are able to manage risk. And, you know, the lessons of 2022 that hopefully a lot of people learned, and most likely the hard way, will be lifetime lessons that they learned.

Because I know that, you know, I learned that I had to manage risk because I lost money. I didn't want to be out of business. So I started cutting my losers. And lo and behold, my winners took care of them. And it's just those basic things, like eat less calories and exercise more, and you'll lose weight. Well, same thing in the market. Cut your losers and hold your winners, and you'll be ahead.

So we all learn things-- at least I do, and I think a lot of people we've seen the evidence bear out, learn things the hard way. So, hopefully, again, they're lifelong lessons, in that they have a much healthier respect for risk.

JARED BLIKRE: And when-- I also know the answer to this question, but we're going to go there anyway. I want to talk about how you take in the news cycle, mainly if you don't, how you communicate to your clients and people who have come to you for help just in terms of tuning out a lot of the daily noise that we get in markets.

And it doesn't have to be necessarily news organizations. Fin Twit is just full of advice, both bad and good, probably erring on the side of bad for a lot. So how do-- how do people-- how should people approach the barrage of information that we get on a daily basis?

BRIAN SHANNON: That's really-- I mean, it's really tough. And it's, you know, up to each individual. Here's what I noticed in my own trading, going back 15, 20 years ago. I would have, you know, financial media on, and they would sometimes say something on television. And I would be the guy, who goes, and goes that's a good idea, I'm going to just scalp a little bit out of it. I'll be in and out real quick.

But then the stock falls, and falls, and falls. And I think, well, you know, maybe-- maybe it's on people's delayed satellite, and they haven't got the news yet, I'll buy some more. So I found-- I found I was reacting to news. And I was losing money as a result.

So I said, well, what's the obvious solution here? You've got to surgically remove the-- the problem. So I don't look at financial news during the day. I look at headlines in the morning to kind of see what's shaping the psychology of the market. And I really don't look at much social media during the day either.

Because to me, I have to work in a vacuum. I've-- I've been doing this full time since 1991. This is my 32nd year full time in front of these screens. I have confidence in my process. I have confidence that if I'm wrong, I have the discipline to take those the small loss where I planned I would, rather than hold on and hope something else is going to happen.

So it's-- it's the confidence that comes from hard-earned lessons, you know, being beaten down by the market, learning continually, keeping your mind open to new ideas. Even today, I'll still-- if somebody says, hey, Brian, I created this oscillator, what do you think? You know, most of the time, I'm thinking, well, it's probably nothing that hasn't been done, but I'll take a look.

Because I'm-- you have to have a curious mind. So the-- where were we going with this, Jared?

JARED BLIKRE: Somebody showed you a new oscillator, maybe it was great. Maybe it's not the greatest thing since sliced bread. Indicators are only so useful, but you never know, maybe there's going to be a new one. I don't know, where were you going?

BRIAN SHANNON: Yeah, well, no, I mean, that's-- that's just part of the whole process, I guess. And how we learn, and keeping social media influences and media influences out. To me, it comes from confidence, and knowing that-- you know, you've seen me say it, by this time, Jared, thousands of times, only price pays.

And I say that to myself to remind myself as well. You would think I'd really get it by now, but I have to remind myself. It doesn't matter what Powell says. It doesn't matter what the CEO says. Give it a little bit of time to shake out. Let the market figure it out. And then follow the price action because only price pays. The market doesn't care about my opinion of the PCE, or the CPI, or the PPI, or the earnings report.

So stay focused on price action is how I view it. Because I know if I do it a different way, I typically lose money.

JARED BLIKRE: All right, we've got a few minutes left here. I want to pull up our charts. I have Bitcoin loaded.

BRIAN SHANNON: OK.

JARED BLIKRE: And I thought we could just kind of tackle this in real time. We've got the all-time high from-- I'm going to call this November 9 of last year. So let me just-- I'm going to add this as an indicator-- search for anchored VWAP. And I think I said 11-9-- there we go-- 2021. And maybe I'll put some bands on there too, and some shading, see what that looks like.

And it looks like I got the date vastly wrong somehow. So let me see what I was doing there. Oh, 002, there we go. There we go, 21.

BRIAN SHANNON: So while you're doing that, that's always-- I'm speaking to the audience here-- off of all-time highs, like we did in--

JARED BLIKRE: Yeah.

BRIAN SHANNON: --in the NASDAQ. That's always a great place to anchor from. And, you know, we see something really important there that I'll let you talk about, Jared.

JARED BLIKRE: I appreciate that. All right, so we've got some standard deviation bands up. You can see, we're getting down to the second standard deviation here. It looks like it's crowding the price chart a little bit.

But I also want to see where we are off of these lows. So I'm going to put another one, 11-8, coincidentally enough, about a year later. So I'm going to go to add my indicators, search for VWAP. There we go-- anchored, and we're going to put in-- let's use the same date, 2023-- done. And once again, I'm going to have to correct this.

But we get the idea here. And so once-- what are you looking for?

BRIAN SHANNON: No, you want to do '22. You did '24.

JARED BLIKRE: Oh, thank you. I appreciate the real-time error correction here because I do need help. There we go. Just wondering, like when you see something like this, maybe it's what you were looking for, maybe it's not. What goes through your head when you're attacking a new market that you haven't looked at in a while or just for the first time?

BRIAN SHANNON: Yeah, so obviously, like you did, anchor one to the all-time high and see how price [INAUDIBLE]. Why has that been important? And you can see there in April of last year, it kind of fought to that area and tried to-- you know, that battle was fought there. And ultimately, the sellers took-- you know, took back control of that battle.

So what I will do is I'll add-- that was a new regime lower. That's where a new real hard sell off began from. So I'll set another anchor right there, Jared. Because that tells me the trend accelerated from there. And we have a new group of participants who are trapped from-- you know, trying to break higher there. And those people are trapped.

So let's try to understand the cumulative average price from that point forward. And maybe that will give us some indication of what's important moving forward. And if you get that on there, I believe, actually, that the market is battling that right now.

JARED BLIKRE: Yes. You can see it came-- yeah, just about came up and kissed it in later April. And then really came up and touched it in February, late January of this year. And now just kind of breaking above and below, so oscillating around it. It may be in line with that porosity that we were talking about. Got to give it a little bit of wiggle room around these key levels.

BRIAN SHANNON: Yeah, so, you know, it's-- it's-- now I look at it and say, well, if it breaks down and fails from here, where is it likely to catch a bid? And I think down at that 19,463, the anchored VWAP from the low, I think that if it were to drop, that's a place where it's likely to engage in the next important battle.

It's a potential level of support because there should be enough price memory there the short sellers say, hey, let's start to cover some down here. Longs say I want to average in. Fresh money from the sidelines says, hey, it's at that price, let's start to build a position. And then lo and behold, that becomes support again, potentially.

But the key is not to just look at it and say, OK, I'm sticking my bid in at $19,463.50 or whatever that is. But to say that's a level of interest. Maybe I'll set an alert at $19,500, and if that alert goes up then I'll start to look for actual evidence on the shorter-term frame, the way we did with that stock, DT, to see, are the buyers, in fact, gaining control?

JARED BLIKRE: Beautiful. All right, you're-- you're handle, your name, Brian Shannon, comma, CMT. CMT stands for Chartered Market Technician. And I want to tease something coming up in a couple of months, which is the 50th anniversary of the CMT. As an organization, it's worldwide and a pretty diverse group of members.

Not the largest organization, but in terms of the spirit of sharing knowledge and just really being on point about what the message of the group is, what the content is, and being thoroughly up to speed on everything in technical analysis, I've never seen a group of people more generous and more focused with respect to their discipline. Just give me a little bit about why you joined the CMT and some-- some of the things that you've done with the CMT over the years.

BRIAN SHANNON: Yeah, I joined the CMT-- I don't remember when, but I got my Chartered America Technician about 10 years ago, I think. And to me, it was here's a professional designation. It kind of-- you know, if you're a professional in the field, you want the credentials that show people that, hey, it doesn't mean I'm the best technical analyst, just like having a doctor degree on your wall doesn't make you the best doctor. But it says that you've gone through the regimen, and you have a basic understanding of a wide body of knowledge.

And that's what they do, is they expose you to all kinds of things, as you know. Point and Figure, all kinds of-- Candlestick, Elliott Wave, you name it, it's in that material. And you're going to walk away with a curiosity to explore further and say, now I want to branch off into this time frame, or I want to branch off and start to develop my own indicators, or really specialize in the relative strength indicator, and how I can apply it.

And you know, so it's really, as you said, a generous organization. The people that I've met there over the years, going to these symposiums, is just a list of who's who in the money management world.

I mean, it's really amazing that you can just walk up to people that, you know, are your financial heroes, really, for me, growing up, and shake their hand, and talk to them, and learn more, and talk about strategy, and develop new ideas, and form partnerships. And just, it's great for all of those-- the information you learn, being better at technical analysis, and, again, more so the relationships.

JARED BLIKRE: Definitely. Are you going to be in town for it in New York?

BRIAN SHANNON: I am, yeah.

JARED BLIKRE: Excellent. So I'm going to invite you, right here and now, into our studio. We'll do something on ""Yahoo Finance Live"" around that time period. And I'm personally looking really forward to going.

We got-- we got just a few minutes left. I'm just wondering, could you share maybe an interesting anecdote from back in the day, that maybe exemplifies what trading was like back in the '90s or the early 2000s? Just something that maybe sticks out and would entertain our viewers as we're thinking about heading out here.

BRIAN SHANNON: Here's a kind of funny one, not for the guy who was involved. I used to run a day trading office in Denver. It was downtown. And I think it was probably about 1995, 1996. We had this one customer who just was kind of-- he was just really laid back. And the poor guy just had really poor timing.

In fact, he was one of those guys who, you'd look at him, and go, hey-- we'll call him Keith-- Keith, just bought this stock. You know, and it looks like-- he was a fade, basically. If he bought--

JARED BLIKRE: He contrary indicator.

BRIAN SHANNON: Yeah, pretty guaranteed to go down. You know, we tried to-- you know, it was my day trading office. I wanted to keep him around-- him around as a customer. I'd say, Keith, do you really want to do that and that sort of thing.

He became real stubborn about it so we used to fade his trades. You know, he would buy and we'd sell short. Anyway, one day he bought what was a big position for him, a couple thousand shares of a $50 stock. And he was going to day trade it because he thought he had some information.

And he goes, hey guys, I'm going to go get a muffin down the street. I'll be right back. You want a coffee or anything? Super nice guy, you know, always thinking about others. And, you know, as soon as he left, he was out of range or view of the office-- we were on the ground floor-- news broke the stock was halted. And then in the interim, it gapped down $12 per share.

And-- and then, we were like, oh, my god, what are we going to say to him when he comes back? And you know, we're ground floor, the windows. We see him walking back with his coffee, not a care in the world, just whistling a tune. And he's holding his muffin in his hand.

And the poor guy, he didn't realize he was down like $35,000. He came into the office, and after that he got the nickname ""The Muffin Man.""

JARED BLIKRE: No. Rough.

BRIAN SHANNON: That was the most expensive muffin anyone ever bought.

JARED BLIKRE: Yeah, it kind of reminds me of the O'Hare trade, which I'll just go over that real quick. I dont' know, have you heard of the O'Hare trade?

BRIAN SHANNON: I haven't.

JARED BLIKRE: All right, kind of a legend. And it's been-- I guess there are variations for other cities. But O'Hare, the major airport in Chicago, and down in the CME and CBOT pits, decades ago, people-- if somebody was looking to make a quick buck, or I guess to lose one, they would look for a volatile day. Put on an outsized trade. And maybe with an hour to go, they'd just walk out of the building, say they were going for lunch.

And the pits closed down maybe 2:00, 3:00 PM. So they'd actually drive to the airport and phone the office when the market closed. And if the position closed hugely in the money, because it was guaranteed to be a big winner or a big loser, they'd drive back to the office. And if they didn't, well, they'd step onto a plane and fly to a jurisdiction with a non-extradition treaty with the US. So that is the O'Hare trade right there.

BRIAN SHANNON: That's what the kids call now the Yolo trade, right?

JARED BLIKRE: Yeah, why not? I think we could rebrand that one.

BRIAN SHANNON: Yeah.

JARED BLIKRE: Anyway, I got to-- I got to promote your book one more time here-- ""Anchored VWAP."" This is just another spectacular book. Your first book, a legend, and a must for any trader trying to earn their-- I guess, stripes, salt, whatever you call it. But this one, ""Maximum Trading Gains with Anchored VWAP, The Perfect Combination of Price, Time, and Volume,"" by Brian Shannon, founder of AlphaTrends.net.

I can't wait to see you in New York in a couple of months here. So we're going to set that up.

BRIAN SHANNON: Likewise, yeah, definitely.

JARED BLIKRE: Yep. And in the meantime, we're going to bid everybody adieu until next time.

BRIAN SHANNON: Bye. Thank you.

If the investment timeline is greater than 10 years, the best stock to buy and hold for a lifetime is arguably the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) as it is a low cost and popular way for investors to own the S&P 500.

By owning the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) for a decade or more, investors can benefit from secular trends such as population growth, productivity growth, and more.

If AI achieves its potential, overall productivity could increase substantially and considerably more goods and services could be produced. If considerably more goods and services are produced, GDP could increase meaningfully and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) could benefit.

Having a long term investing timeline is an advantage as in the near term it is arguably harder for investors to benefit from secular trends.

In the near term, markets can also fluctuate substantially as valuations can change based on a variety of economic, industry, and corporate developments, all of which can be unpredictable.

Individual Stocks

In terms of buying individual stocks rather than the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), the best stocks to buy and hold for a lifetime are arguably blue chips with substantial competitive advantages with growth potential in the future.

Some leading blue chips in technology, also known as big tech, can do well in terms of artificial intelligence if they continue to innovate and gain meaningful market share in the big markets in the future. Companies like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) can benefit from the rise of AI from more demand for cloud processing, for instance.

One example of big tech benefiting is OpenAI's ChatGPT. Although it still makes plenty of mistakes, the growth in the AI application ChatGPT has been unparalleled as ChatGPT has surpassed 100 million users in two months since its launch. Given ChatGPT uses Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s cloud for processing, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has benefited from the rise in popularity of the app both as an investor in OpenAI and as a provider of cloud processing for OpenAI's ChatGPT.

Some leading blue chips in finance can do well if the overall economy does well. If AI increases productivity, the overall economy could grow. If the overall economy grows, some of the leading finance blue chips such as leading big four American banks could do well from more potential loans and more potential deposits. With more business, they could potentially have more earnings poewr.

In the near term, the market is uncertain. On one hand, the unemployment rate in the U.S. economy is low and U.S. GDP is expanding. On the other hand, the Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates further. If the U.S. central bank raises interest rates too much, the economy could slowdown substantially or enter into a recession.

Given the market is always uncertain, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well versified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.

Wednesday, February 22, 2023

Today's newsletter is by Jared Blikre, a reporter focused on the markets on Yahoo Finance. Follow him on Twitter @SPYJared. Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App.

The major U.S. indices had their worst day of 2023 on Tuesday, with the Nasdaq (^IXIC), closing down more than 6% from its early-February high. Meanwhile, U.S. Treasury rates jumped to five-month highs with Federal Reserve hawkishness in focus.

U.S. equities — particular tech stocks — are quickly weakening against a backdrop of interest rates that are once again surging higher. We've seen this play out several times since stocks peaked over a year ago when interest rate volatility in the bond market gave way to stock market volatility (meaning stocks sell off).

The difference in 2023 — as we've been writing — is that growth stocks (like the unloved tech stocks) had once again been leading the way after taking a back seat to cyclical and value stocks throughout 2022.

The chart above shows that many of the worst-performing stocks from 2022 are this year's winners. Last year's duds caught Wall Street flat-footed and short this year — mounting a vicious rip-your-face-off rally.

Tesla (TSLA) is up 60% in 2023 after shedding three quarters of its value from its November 2021 high. Nvidia (NVDA) and Meta Platforms (META) are each holding onto gains of 40% or more this year.

The result is that Investors who were massively underwater on tech names coming into the year were given a tantalizing reminder of the fast and furious gains made in the space in years prior.

Will the rally continue?

Things have moved so rapidly and into such unchartered territory over this business cycle that massive disagreements have emerged among investors looking at different things — each through their own lens.

Story continues

Technical traders can point to charts of global indices and large U.S. sectors breaking out to new highs (as they've been doing since late-2022). Macro investors may chalk off the 2023 rally as junk-led, YOLO-redux and point to a potential hard landing that's now simply been delayed. Central bank and shadow banking buffs who track liquidity can point to the virtual flood of yen and yuan being ""printed"" by the Japanese and Chinese central banks this year — so big that it potentially offsets the Federal Reserve's quantitative tightening. Finally, economists — after months of debating a hard versus soft landing — can point to a metaphor-destroying, ""no landing"" non sequitur.

Some of these theories are mutually compatible given the differing timeframes. But as the dust settles on Wednesday's rout, it's important to remember that low-quality stocks with bad balance sheets and cash flow are unlikely to lead meaningfully again — even if the major indices resume their rallies.

Callie Cox, US investment analyst at eToro USA, pointed out in a note to clients that looking inside the Russell 3000 — a broad measure of small, mid, and large-cap U.S. stocks — 44 of the 50 best-performing stocks this year didn't generate any profits over the past 12 months.

""That’s strange, considering that higher bond yields should entice investors to focus on profits and cash flows,"" she says, noting the cognitive dissonance.

Cox urges investors to tread carefully but not to run for the hills.

""When rates are high, it’s smart to focus on what’s making money now while keeping your guard up with hedges and a defensive lean,"" she says, adding, ""Long-term investors may have an argument to take on some risk here, but they need to focus on quality companies, even if those quality companies fall into growth categories.""

138,2023-02-16T19:38:01+00:00,Retail investors are pouring a record $1.5 billion per day into the stock market,"Individual investors have been snapping up stocks at the fastest pace on record as U.S. equity markets have charged higher to start the year.

Over the past month, retail investors funneled an average of $1.51 billion each day into U.S. stocks, the highest amount ever recorded, according to data from research firm VandaTrack published Thursday.

""With recent surveys showing the institutional investor community remaining broadly bearish on stocks, it would be unwise to underestimate the importance of the retail cohort,"" strategists at VandaTrack said in a note. ""That's in keeping with retail sales and jobs data for January, suggesting that consumers retain impressive levels of buying power."" In the last month, retail investors poured an average of $1.51 billion per day into U.S. equities, the highest amount ever recorded. (Source: VandaTrack)

Tesla (TSLA) remained the favorite among this group, with retail inflows to the stock totaling $9.7 billion year to date.

Those allocations come during a comeback rally for the electric vehicle giant after closing out its worst year on record in 2022. Tesla shares have gained 74% in 2023 through Wednesday's close.

The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), an ETF which tracks the benchmark S&P 500, has been the second-most popular purchase by retail investors this year, with retail flows totaling $3.6 billion in 2023. The index is up 8.2% year to date through Wednesday.

Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), and Nvidia (NVDA) rounded out the top five, receiving $1.8 billion, $1.7 billion, and $1.4 billion in inflows this year, respectively. These names were up 20%, 19.5%, and 55.8% this year in that order. Tesla CEO Elon Musk and his security detail depart the company’s local office in Washington, U.S. January 27, 2023.

More speculative, beaten-down names have also been popular buys, with investors again circling baskets of stocks favored by ARK Invest's Cathie Wood.

Wood's flagship ARK Innovation (ARKK) ETF, a bellwether for high-flying technology stocks, has seen a modest uptick in inflows this year, but stood 27th on a list of the biggest purchases from retail investors ponying up $169 million for the fund.

Retail investors did, however, snag key underlying names from ARK's family of exchange-traded funds — Coinbase (COIN), Block (SQ), Roku (ROKU), for example — faster than the firm itself, a phenomenon seen early into the COVID pandemic.

Story continues

""It was common back in 2020-2021 for retail investors to buy ARK ETFs while at the same time piling in some of their more hyped underlyings,"" the team at VandaTrack said. ""While we don't expect retail speculation to reach those levels, it is noteworthy that retail investors are vastly outpacing Cathie Wood and Co. regarding purchases across some of these names.""

ARK Innovation was up 38.3% to date through Wednesday.

""Soaring retail investor flows underpin the outperformance of their favorite stocks,"" VandaTrack researchers said, adding retail flows have accounted for an $18.5 billion capital injection in these names in 2023.

""Should positive momentum in the broad equity market persist, it could push retail investors toward more speculative names, which are more susceptible to such flows given their smaller market cap.""

The broader stock market has declined substantially in bear markets.

During the Great Recession, for example, the S&P 500 declined almost 57% from its peak in 2007.

Nevertheless, the market has risen over the long term. The S&P 500 is more than double its 2007 peak for instance.

Given they are young, many 18 year olds have the advantage of being long term investors. As a result, they can have longer holding periods.

With longer holding periods, the broader market benefits from population growth and productivity growth. With more population, there are more consumers and potentially more demand for products and services. With more productivity growth, more products and services could be produced in total.

Over the long term, the broader market also benefits from factors such as companies buying back their stock. If a company buys back its stock and doesn't issue any new ones, a company's EPS could rise even if its earnings stays the same.

In terms of the best stocks to buy for an 18 year old, the best stock to buy is probably a popular low cost S&P 500 index fund like SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY).

Not only is there built-in diversification with SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), but there is also relatively low fees involved.

According to the ETF, SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) has a gross expense ratio of 0.0945%. In terms of the fund characteristics, the ETF has as of February 14, an estimated 3-5 year EPS growth ratio of 11.86%, a price to cash flow ratio of 14.22, and a price to earnings ratio of 20.72.

If the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) isn't an option, the best stocks to buy are arguably quality blue chips with substantial competitive advantages and wide moats.

With competitive advantages such as strong brands and substantial scale, the companies could find it easier to maintain or grow their profitability through market cycles than companies with less of a competitive advantage.

Story continues

Given some companies underperform even when they have many competitive advantages, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.

In terms of the stocks to own in the future for an 18 year old, big tech blue chips that trade for fair valuations and that also have potential growth opportunities in AI are potential candidates for investment as well.

140,2023-02-14T12:12:55+00:00,"Burry's Scion Asset adds Alibaba, JD.com, MGM Resorts, dumps CoreCivic and Charter","By Daniel Shvartsman

Investing.com -- Michael Burry's Scion Asset Management fund turned over nearly its entire portfolio in Q4 2022, as disclosed on their latest form 13F filing. The famed Big Short investor made a bet on two China-based giants while closing his cable industry bets and reducing his private prison industry positions. All figures are as of December 31st, 2022.

On the adds side, Burry bought 50,000 shares of Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), a position in the Chinese e-commerce giant worth $4.4 million. He also opened a $4.2M position in JD.com (NASDAQ:JD), perhaps anticipating the reopening process China started this year.

He also opened a position in Black Knight (NYSE:BKI), a merger arbitrage given the mortgage software firm's agreement to a deal with Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE), and Coherent (NASDAQ:COHR), a semiconductor equipment and laser company that itself is the product of a merger from II-VI and Coherent. Black Knight is flat on the day and Coherent is up .8%, despite the Nasdaq being down nearly 1%.

Burry's biggest position remains GEO Group (NYSE:GEO), the private prison REIT, but he reduced his position by 50% on a shares basis. GEO Group is down over 13% today on its earnings release today. Given the REIT rose 42% in value in Q4, the value of the position is still outsized for Burry. The value investor did close his position in GEO Group's peer, CoreCivic Inc (NYSE:CXW), and also reduced his position in Qurate Retail Group (NASDAQ:QRTEA) by 75%.

Other positions Burry sold include Charter Communications Inc (NASDAQ:CHTR), Liberty Latin America Ltd (NASDAQ:LILAK), and Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc (NYSE:AJRD).

Burry's last three positions are in MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM), SkyWest Inc (NASDAQ:SKYW), and Wolverine World Wide Inc (NYSE:WWW). SkyWest is up 3% and Wolverine World Wide is up 2% in mid-day trading.

Michael Burry runs a concentrated portfolio, though in recent years his holding period has been shorter. His Twitter account has gotten increasing notoriety over recent years, and he tweeted ""Sell"" with no further elaboration two weeks ago in a subsequently deleted tweet. While he does not publicly discuss performance, InvestingPro's tracking of his holdings suggests he has outperformed the SPDR® S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:SPY) with 11.3% performance vs. the ETF dropping 3.5%.

Investing.com -- George Soros's fund Soros Fund Management opened new positions in Horizon Therapeutics (NASDAQ:HZNP) and First Horizon National Corporation (NYSE:FHN), while also nearly doubling its position in Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and trimming its position in Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN).

Soros Fund Management opened a position worth $325M in Horizon Therapeutics as of the firm's Form 13F filing, which dates to December 31st and was published yesterday. The pharmaceutical company agreed to a buy out by Amgen Inc (NASDAQ:AMGN) late last year, and trades more than 6.3% below its agreed deal price of $116.5. First Horizon National Corporation is another merger arbitrage play, as the bank is due to be bought out by Toronto Dominion Bank (NYSE:TD) in a deal expected to close at the end of the quarter. This comes after Soros's fund successfully held merger arbitrage positions in Duke Realty (NYSE:DRE), Twitter, and Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holding Co Ltd (NYSE:BHVN) last quarter.

Soros's fund also nearly doubled its position in Alphabet, increasing the Class A shares position by 73% and adding a small Class C share position. This filing's data predates the recent angst over ChatGPT, and Alphabet is up only 7% this year, lagging the Nasdaq. Soros Fund reduced its position in Amazon by more than half, dropping from 1.98M shares in the company to 901K.

Other new positions included Altra Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:AIMC), common stock and put holdings in Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) and Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS), and a new call position in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). Soros Fund Management also increased positions in Cboe Global Markets Inc (NYSE:CBOE), Tesla's common stock, 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD), Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), and Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS).

The fund decreased positions in D.R. Horton Inc (BVMF:D1HI34), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), and Nike (NYSE:NKE). It also liquidated positions in Atlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM), Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK), Global Blood Therapeutics (NASDAQ:GBT), and Zoom Video Communications Inc (NASDAQ:ZM).

While there's limited public reporting on George Soros's performance last year, according to the tracking on InvestingPro, his holdings measured from end of quarter to end of quarter have gained 9.5% in value in the last year, versus -3% in the SPDR® S&P 500 (NYSE:SPY).

143,2023-02-13T11:20:23+00:00,Current stock market rally 'likely to mark the high point' for 2023: JP Morgan,"JP Morgan says investors shouldn't get too comfortable with the stock market's impressive start to 2023.

""Big picture, we believe that the equity rally that started last October, and that we hoped would be driven by peaking bond yields/CPI, China reopening, and the fall in European gas prices, is unlikely to get the fundamental confirmation for the next leg higher as the year progresses,"" closely-watched JP Morgan strategist Mislav Matejka wrote in a note on Monday. ""Once the positioning recovers, Q1 is in our view likely to mark the high point of the market.""

Matejka recommends investors slash their exposure to stocks — which he says sport ""questionably"" high valuations — and eye more defense areas of the market. The strategist struck a notable cautious tone on tech stocks amid their big rally out of the gate this year.

""These big positives are not finished, but are clearly not fresh anymore,"" Matejka added, ""and now there is some complacency setting in on multiple fronts.""

The strong rally across the major indices so far this year has surprised many market watchers, especially given that the Federal Reserve is hot off another interest rate hike as it continues to try and combat nagging inflation.

Several Fed members, including Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic to Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, have come out since the last Fed meeting with warnings rates may have to head higher than investors currently expect.

And while the Fed is widely expected to pause its rate increases this year, the timing is uncertain. That leaves investors staring down the barrel of potentially multiple more rate increases that could have the effect of slowing the economy and compressing relatively elevated stock valuation multiples.

Corporate America, meanwhile, is slogging through a disappointing earnings season that arguably doesn't justify the market's 2023 advance.

Big household name companies such as Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Snap (SNAP), Microsoft (MSFT) and Starbucks (SBUX) posted weak fourth quarter earnings while also offering cautious forward-looking commentary.

144,2023-02-13T11:20:23+00:00,Current stock market rally 'likely to mark the high point' for 2023: JPMorgan,"JPMorgan says investors shouldn't get too comfortable with the stock market's impressive start to 2023.

""Big picture, we believe that the equity rally that started last October, and that we hoped would be driven by peaking bond yields/CPI, China reopening, and the fall in European gas prices, is unlikely to get the fundamental confirmation for the next leg higher as the year progresses,"" closely-watched JP Morgan strategist Mislav Matejka wrote in a note on Monday. ""Once the positioning recovers, Q1 is in our view likely to mark the high point of the market.""

Matejka recommends investors slash their exposure to stocks — which he says sport ""questionably"" high valuations — and eye more defense areas of the market. The strategist struck a notable cautious tone on tech stocks amid their big rally out of the gate this year.

""These big positives are not finished, but are clearly not fresh anymore,"" Matejka added, ""and now there is some complacency setting in on multiple fronts.""

The strong rally across the major indices so far this year has surprised many market watchers, especially given that the Federal Reserve is hot off another interest rate hike as it continues to try and combat nagging inflation.

Several Fed members, including Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic to Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, have come out since the last Fed meeting with warnings rates may have to head higher than investors currently expect.

And while the Fed is widely expected to pause its rate increases this year, the timing is uncertain. That leaves investors staring down the barrel of potentially multiple more rate increases that could have the effect of slowing the economy and compressing relatively elevated stock valuation multiples.

Corporate America, meanwhile, is slogging through a disappointing earnings season that arguably doesn't justify the market's 2023 advance.

Big household name companies such as Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Snap (SNAP), Microsoft (MSFT) and Starbucks (SBUX) posted weak fourth quarter earnings while also offering cautious forward-looking commentary.

Thursday, February 9, 2023

Today's newsletter is by Jared Blikre, a reporter focused on the markets on Yahoo Finance. Follow him on Twitter @SPYJared. Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App.

Tech has had its greatest start to the year since 2019, with the Nasdaq Composite gaining just under 14% in the 26 sessions this year — even with Wednesday's red close across the major U.S. indices.

Yet for those investors waiting for the all-clear before jumping all-in long, at least one critical hurdle remains for bulls to demonstrate they've successfully taken the reins from the bears: the night.

Specifically, bulls need to assert dominance not only during the normal trading day (from the opening to closing bells) — but also after, during the much longer time period from the close to the open.

The U.S. stock market is open 6.5 hours each day — from 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Conversely, this means it's closed 17.5 hours of the day — or 73% of the time on any given week day. Throw in two full days of inactivity over the weekend, and in any given week, the market is closed over 80% of the time. (Yes, after-hours sessions extend this considerably, but this is not an option for large investors in need of liquidity to absorb big orders.)

It's not surprising to find that the overnight and weekend returns generally lead the overall market. That is, the net returns over time from the close each night to the open each morning tend to directionally confirm whether stocks are going net up (a bull market), or down (a bear market).

To study this, we use the SPDR S&P 500 Trust (SPY) as a proxy for the overall market, beginning in mid-1998 (when our intraday data begins). Over that time, SPY is up 301 points, with 92% of those gains (277 points) coming outside of regular trading hours. This means, had you stayed out of the market each trading day — buying on the close and selling on the open — you'd stillhave 92% of the market's overall gains.

Story continues

We can find even more useful information by subdividing the day session between the bells into three smaller parts — the opening two hours, the closing two hours, and the time in between (colloquially called ""lunch"" or the ""daily doldrums"").

Not surprisingly, what happens during the middle of the day isn't that predictive or reflective of the market's overall direction. But the close is quite useful. (Conventional market wisdom posits that investors buying toward the close are better-informed than those trading toward the open, and there are several technical indicators that attempt to capture what the ""smart money"" is doing.)

Also called the settlement, the close is the day's most important reference price. It's what is used to calculate mark-to-market returns presented to investors and regulators. Therefore, it's not surprising to find more buying than selling activity in the final two hours of the day in a bull market — and more selling than buying in a bear market. Returns for the SPDR S&P 500 Trust (SPY) are broken down by time of day.

Looking at the above chart, we can see that right now the gains this year have been made throughout the trading day, including the final two hours. But critically, investors have been taking losses outside of regular, liquid trading hours since November.

If investors are getting hurt on overnight trades because of market conditions, then we would expect them to be even more risk-averse from pummelings over the weekend. Indeed, breaking down SPY returns by the day of the week reveals that since the October lows, Mondays have been producing negative returns. Even if we exclude Monday's day session and add up the return from Friday's close to Monday's open (not shown), the results are substantially similar. Returns for the SPDR S&P 500 Trust (SPY) are broken down by day of the week.

Wednesdays have also been negative since the October lows due, in part, to some steep losses following Federal Reserve decisions. Wednesday's 1.1% loss this week didn't help, but overall, hump-day returns have traded sideways in 2023.

Meanwhile, all the net gains have been made on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays.

Bottom line — looking at the market under-the-hood, it has improved considerably since October, but still has a bit to go before the transformation from bear to bull is complete. Investors are being punished by holding during those long stretches outside market hours when liquidity is scarce or nonexistent.

Until that changes, the bearish character of the market ought to persist.

83% indicate their financial advisor has informed them how market volatility will affect their long-term financial goals.

With volatility in the market, 57% of US investors plan to keep their money ""as is"" and stick to their long-term strategy.

Nearly two-thirds (64%) think the volatility in the stock market is going to continue for at least the next 12 months.

Nearly three-quarters (74%) are worried about inflation.

BOSTON, February 06, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--State Street Global Advisors, the asset management business of State Street Corporation (NYSE: STT), today released the results of its ETF Impact Survey: Advisor Edition which found an overwhelming majority of investors who work with an advisor remain confident in their insight and guidance, even as 2022 closed with lingering concerns over inflation and the potential for continued market volatility.

The percentage of US investors indicating they value their financial advisors’ knowledge and guidance even more during uncertain times held steady at 89% compared to June 2022, when it was 91%; 81% indicate their financial advisor has helped them remain confident in this period of rising inflation and market volatility, compared to 86% in June.

""Helping clients remain confident and committed during times of volatility can be a challenge for advisors whose clients may have a kneejerk reaction to abandon their investment strategy if markets get choppy,"" said Brie Williams, head of Practice Management at State Street Global Advisors. ""Our survey found 86% of investors have discussed market volatility with their financial advisor and 83% say their advisor has informed them of how volatility will affect their long-term financial goals.""

It seems investors are getting the message about sticking to their long-term investment strategy. The survey found even with volatility in the market, 57% of US investors plan to keep their money ‘as is’ and stick to their long-term strategy.

Story continues

Furthermore, 17% plan to leave their money as is, but opportunistically invest more if market conditions permit, while 18% indicate they will move money to other investments to reduce the risk of loss. A mere 8% plan to retreat to cash to avoid potential loss.

Top Financial Concerns Among US Investors

The survey found 71% of US investors are ""optimistic"" or ""very optimistic"" about their own financial future over the next 12 months. While this number may seem high, it is significantly lower than pre-pandemic levels when it was 88% toward the end of 2019, at the close of a decade-long bull market.

Today, nearly three-quarters (74%) of investors are worried about inflation. Although inflation concerns have waned slightly since June (76%), they’re still relatively high when compared to the pre-pandemic levels of 71%.

Since last June, general concern over market volatility has declined 11 percentage points to 46%. Still, the percentage of those concerned about the value of their actual investments eroding has held steady since June, when it was at 59% compared to 56% today.

Taking a look at concerns over long-term saving goals like retirement reveal a slightly different story. Worry over retirement is seeing an uptick, with 52% indicating concern about saving enough for retirement versus 45% in June. Similarly, 50% fear running out of money in retirement versus 46% in June.

ETF Investor Perception

January 2023 marked the 30th anniversary of the first ever US-listed exchange traded fund (ETF), the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY). Launched on January 22, 1993, SPY is the world’s largest ETF with more than $355 billion in assets and the most heavily traded security in the world with an average daily trading volume of $39 billion.

Overall, perception of the benefits ETFs have brought to investors has been overwhelmingly positive. The survey found that 59% of US investors with an existing ETF holding report that ETFs have improved the overall performance of their portfolio. Furthermore, more than half (53%) of US investors believe ETFs have made them a better investor.

""Advisor adoption of ETFs has provided investors with cost-effective access to institutional-grade solutions,"" said Williams. ""The flexibility to buy and sell shares quickly, easily, and cost-efficiently is important to advisors and their clients in all markets.""

In 2022, 65% of advisors recommend using ETFs in their portfolios, and 41% of advisors are looking to increase their usage of ETFs in the next twelve months. †

""Investors continue to turn to ETFs for their inherent liquidity benefits,"" said Colin Ireland, head of ETF Execution Strategy at State Street Global Advisors ""These benefits often become most pronounced in times of volatility – when investors need it most. Among SPY’s many milestones: in 2020 it became the first ETF to trade more than $100 billion in a single session amidst the COVID-19 induced volatility.""

ETF use cases in the advisory market have expanded significantly in the three decades since SPY’s launch, and continue to evolve beyond just asset allocation and diversification planning. A number of wealth management firms use ETFs to package their investment beliefs into outcome-oriented products for their clients. ETFs have also been used to create model portfolios that give advisors the ability to outsource the investment component so that they can focus more attention on client outcomes.

International equity ETFs led the way higher with $7.5 billion in inflows, closely followed by $1.4 billion in international fixed-income ETFs and $1 billion in inverse ETFs, per etf.com.

As such, JPMorgan BetaBuilders Europe ETF BBEU, SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF LQD, JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF JEPI and ProShares UltraPro Short QQQ SQQQ dominated the top creation list last week.

International stocks have been performing better than the U.S. stocks. These offer more enticing valuations after a long period of U.S. dominance. Additionally, a weak dollar is providing a boost to international stocks. The U.S. dollar against a basket of currencies has been on a downtrend this year, with the US Dollar Index hovering at a seven-month low after peaking at a 20-year high last September.

The weak trend is likely to continue, given the higher speculation over the Fed’s slower rate hike. This is because a strong greenback generally eats away foreign investment gains when repatriated in U.S. dollar terms. Additionally, the reopening of China after a speedy Zero-Covid policy exit should fuel growth globally.

We have given details of the ETFs below:

JPMorgan BetaBuilders Europe ETF (BBEU)

JPMorgan BetaBuilders Europe ETF topped asset flow creation last week, gathering $2.5 billion in capital.

151,2023-01-31T11:39:54+00:00,Stock market: 3 expert observations about January 2023's spirited move,"Investors have had a slew of downbeat headlines to kick off 2023.

Eye-popping layoff news from tech stalwarts Amazon, Microsoft, Salesforce and 3M. Chip giant Intel reported another tough outlook amid a major slowdown in PC demand. Ford and Tesla slashing prices on EVs as the economy has cooled. Signs that inflation continues to slow — but not at such a rapid pace as to suggest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve later this year. Earnings are meh.

And yet stocks are off to a surprisingly solid start to the year.

As of this writing, the Nasdaq Composite has posted a nearly 9% gain so far in 2023, per Yahoo Finance data. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average have clocked in with 4.65% and 1.7% advances, respectively.

It's unclear if January will be as good as it gets for stocks this year or the party will continue — in any case, the action has been interesting to watch. Here are a few interesting stats from 2023 served up by astute market strategist Keith Lerner at Truist:

1. Investors are feeling the forgotten.

The 50 worst-performing stocks of 2022 are up an average of 20.1% so far this year, according to Lerner's research. The 50 best-performing stocks from last year, meanwhile, are up an average of only 1.9%.

""We view this as most likely a short-term reversion of oversold stocks as opposed to new market leadership or a fundamental shift,"" Lerner says.

2. Investors pump up PEs.

Analyst earnings estimates for the S&P 500 have ticked down to an 11-month low, Lerner noted. So, the advance in stocks has been fueled by rising price-to-earnings multiples — likely on the hope the Fed halts its rate hikes mid-year.

The S&P 500’s forward PE ratio has jumped back to 17.9 times, near the peak level of 18.0x-18.5x it traded to over the past decade outside of the pandemic highs.

""While this is typical during the early stages of a new bull market, since prices tend to advance well before earnings and the economy turn up, we remain skeptical,"" Lerner wrote. ""Our view is investors, as reflected in rising valuations, are placing too high of a probability on a soft economic landing and leaving little margin for error.""

3. 'indiscriminate buying'

Going back to the previously out-of-favor stocks...

Lerner notes that ""remarkably,"" all 50 of last year’s worst performing stocks are up in 2023.

The appetite to buy these names ""indiscriminate buying"", Lerner says.

Today's newsletter is by Jared Blikre, a reporter focused on the markets on Yahoo Finance. Follow him on Twitter @SPYJared. Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App.

Stocks mounted an impressive comeback Wednesday, with the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) nearly erasing its biggest opening deficit since October. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) eked out a small gain — its fourth straight — after spending most of the day in the red.

Even Microsoft (MSFT) rallied back from a 4.6% early loss to end the day down only about half a percent.

As we've been writing, this year's market action has been a reversal of one of last year's most important trends, which saw the Dow outperform the Nasdaq by the widest margin in two decades.

This year, the Nasdaq is now up 8%, substantially outperforming the Dow's return of just under 2%.

And while it's unlikely a new bull market led by tech has begun, this relative performance is a tantalizing reminder of the gains tech bulls reaped in growth stocks during the ultra-low interest rate regime that had prevailed since the Global Financial Crisis.

And with several benchmark indexes right now at key levels, a squeeze out of current trading ranges would likely generate upside momentum.

First, take a look at the highly cyclical semiconductor space, where the PHLX Semiconductor Index (^SOX) is attempting to break out of a 9-month long inverse head-and-shoulders technical formation.

A breakout higher would suggest bulls retaking control after bears dictated price action for most of 2022. The PHLX Semiconductor Index is breaking the neckline of an inverse head and shoulders pattern.

If the majors follow suit and manage their own respective technical breakouts, those moves would likely generate significant momentum given the duration of the consolidation under current levels. The longer an index, stock, ETF, or any other traded asset consolidates around a particular price level, the stronger moves tend to be when the price breaks higher or lower.

Story continues

For the S&P 500, the December highs around 4,100 mark the upper end of the current range; the index closed at 4,016 on Wednesday.

Meanwhile, Nasdaq has been constrained by 11,500 on the upper end since September, while the Dow has been stuck under 34,500 since April. These indexes closed at 11,313 and 33,743, respectively, on Wednesday.

However, it would be slightly unusual for risk markets to simply rally from here given how stretched the Nasdaq is versus the Dow — as evidenced by the below chart, which dates back to the beginning of the pandemic. Dow Jones Industrial Average vs. Nasdaq Composite

The Dow's weakness in the face of Nasdaq strength this year appears to have reached a short-term extreme, and is in the process of reversing. And extreme readings have tended to coincide with short-term highs in stocks since the bear market got under way last year. However, during the pandemic bull market of 2020-2021, these extreme readings of relative outperformance tended to do little to dent the rally.

So, if the major indexes do roll over from here, tech and growth stocks would likely sell off more than cyclical and defensive names, allowing the Dow's performance relative to the Nasdaq to normalize in the short-term. For those concerned with news and fundamentals instead of the technicals, the narrative to explain this price action would likely fixate around a hawkish Fed, higher rates, and disappointing earnings du jour.

Conversely, if chip stocks and the big benchmark indexes rip higher through current resistance, that would likely send the Dow-to-Nasdaq ratio sinking far below its current level.

The bottom line is that stocks could very well surge from here, and the technical setup suggests we're a crucial juncture for this year's market rally.

But any rally led tech stocks is likely to be fast, furious, and short-lived.

Otherwise, markets will need to consolidate and save energy for a more durable move higher another day.

154,2023-01-25T20:45:00+00:00,Jim Ross Looks Back Over SPY’s 30 Years,"Jim Ross

The SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), the first U.S.-listed exchange-traded fund, turned 30 this week, with more than $370 billion in assets under management. Jim Ross, now the chairman of special purpose acquisition company Fusion Acquisition Corp. II, was involved in the early days of SPY helping to keep the product’s books before it even launched and managing accounting for the new fund once it was trading.

As his role developed further at State Street, he became the public face of SPY, giving presentations about the fund and educating investors and market participants on how ETFs work. After 28 years, he retired from State Street Global Advisors as an executive vice president and the chairman of its ETF business.

ETF.com’s Heather Bell spoke with him about his role and his thoughts on the product he helped run and popularize.

ETF.com: Would you talk about your role in the creation of SPY?

Jim Ross: I joined State Street at the end of July 1992. They had a new group going, a kind of emerging business they were starting, called fund administration. I was hired into that and got out of public accounting, which was probably one of the happiest days of my life.

I didn't have a ton of work, and I was used to working a lot. At one point, I went to my boss and my boss's boss [and said], “I need more work.”

They said more work was coming and to just be patient. I just wasn't used to not working hard. When I came out of public accounting, I was working 60-80 hours a week.

Finally, there was a group of people who were working really hard on something [and] I had no idea what it was. [Finally] I was brought on to the project in late October to early November 1992 because I could do the financial statements that were required for the IPO.

I'm literally the most junior person on this team, and I’m just doing whatever it takes, including doing financial statements until 1:00 in the morning on the UIT. [SPY is structured as a unit investment trust, which has a fixed portfolio, while most ETFs today are structured as open-end funds, meaning those investments can be managed.]

Story continues

[The structure] has unique rules such that you had to close the books after the close, and then have an audit of it before you open the next day, which, for UITs, is always just funded with cash. That was never difficult to do. For UITs funded with 500 shares of in-kind stock and cash, there's a lot of work to do.

I get a lot of credit for SPY, and I deserve none. [There are] a lot of things I think I should get some credit for, including launching GLD and the first ETFs in Australia and Hong Kong. I wasn’t at the bell ringing for SPY—I was back in Boston. Everyone was celebrating and I was in my office in my cubicle in Quincy, Massachusetts, working overnight.

ETF.com: You were the duck legs under the water that no one sees paddling?

Ross: For years, that was the role I played. I think most folks who know me now don't see me as that. In the early days, my first job was to really understand it, so I became an expert in things like creations and redemptions, the trading side of it and a whole bunch of different things.

ETF.com: Were there any roadblocks on the way?

Ross: This process started in 1989, which is why the Canadian folks say we started it and they got there first. [The world’s first ETF launched in Canada in 1990.] In the first few years, we were dealing with the SEC, and we were trying to figure out what they would allow.

They wanted this product. They asked for the industry to come up with something that would work better than what was called portfolio insurance, because it did not work in 1987 during the crash. They wanted to solve [the problem], but they also wanted it to be something they understood. This was so different, they really struggled with it, was my understanding.

People will ask why it was the way it was, why the UIT [structure], because that doesn't make any sense today. That's what the SEC would allow at the time. The SEC would not allow you to do a direct mutual fund ’40 Act [product] like they allow people to do now.

And they didn't allow that for SPY, MDY, DIA. At some point, Morgan Stanley had [launched] the WEBS (country ETFs), which was a [’40 Act] series trust, and then when we did the Sector SPDRs, we did it as a series of ’40 Act [open-end] funds, not UITs. It took [the SEC] four or five years to get comfortable with that.

ETF.com: What were the SEC’s concerns about a ’40 Act structure?

Ross: Because [UITs are] seen as unmanaged, they liked [them] better. It is a very stringent requirement [regarding] what they are allowed to do to manage that product. And it's not as flexible as if you're in a more traditional fund structure today. There are some pluses and minuses to that. But it's very predictable, and The Street knows it.

ETF.com: Was there any skepticism around SPY when it was being created and launched?

Ross: A lot. My boss's boss put a lot of effort and State Street technology dollars into this. He was literally [saying], “I hope this works.”

One of the things about UITs is you can't just close them if they don't work. If you look at the prospectus for SPY, it says that if we don't have over $350 million in two years, it automatically just shuts down.

I bought some at the end of year one. [It was] literally above where it needed to be, but it was not seen as a smashing success in the early days. But then it did a strange thing—it just started to double: $400 million to $800 million, $800 million to $1.6 billion and $1.6 billion to $3.2 billion. It just kept on doubling for about five years.

We knew we had something that was probably going to stay around for a while.

ETF.com: Did you ever suspect it would be the foundation of what's become basically a $10 trillion global industry?

Ross: Not that [far] back in the early days, 1992. Investment banks and large brokerage firms weren’t exactly cheering on ETFs in the early days. That's back when they were selling stocks on commissions and a product that gets you access to 500 stocks for one commission was not something that was really of interest to them. The Sector SPDRs were really the first venture that was pretty much focused on retail accounts.

Even in the early 2000s, when Barclays Global Investors [the firm that debuted the iShares family] launched and came in with a very good strategy and plan, they were focused on direct retail to start. And they had to pivot to the financial advice world, which they did.

They did well over time, but there was talk in San Francisco in 2002 [about] shutting down iShares. My understanding was the traditional indexing folks didn’t like this new stepchild, and this new stepchild was getting a lot of money and a lot of investment and wasn't breaking even. There was a significant amount of internal strife about whether or not to even keep it going. [The iShares were eventually sold to BlackRock in 2009.]

ETF.com: How has SPY changed investing and the financial industry?

Ross: It was a catalyst to giving investors a lot more choice. We could talk about ETFs giving too much choice today, but that's a different question. I think what it created, and then what the marketplace did with it—and this is where I think it's unique. A lot of the ETF sponsors like to take a lot of credit for the growth of ETFs, but I think about it [as] people using the products.

I go back to AG Edwards creating the first ETF wrap for their financial advisors to use, and I think they were charging 2%. No one cared—it was unique. And then you had a bunch of other factors.

The changing of the whole brokerage world going from commission-based to fee-based was huge. ETFs didn't fit in a commission-based financial advisor world and never would. But in the fee-based world where low cost was important for those online products, that was hugely important.

At the same time, you have the market forces of spreads compressing from competition between the exchanges.

And all of that brought down the cost of getting into ETFs and continues to bring the cost of buying ETFs down and down, which has just allowed for investors of all kinds, institutional, financial advisors, all these folks to come up with unique ways of using them to solve their problems, and frankly, to solve millions of investors’ challenges about how to best invest for their own purposes, whether they're trying to buy a boat or retire with a couple of dollars in their pocket.

I've had some people call it the greatest financial innovation since the money market fund. I was like, “Hmm, that’s interesting. I never thought the money market fund was that innovative.”

I [also] heard it called the greatest financial innovation of the 20th century. I'm not one for putting labels on this. I was happy to be a part of it, to see it through from early stages to [becoming] just a huge growth engine for a lot of different firms. And just to see what it did for investors.

I also think we forget about [the fact] that it created a lot of jobs if you think about the ecosystem. It created etf.com. It might have cost some jobs, but you’ve just got to compete.

156,2023-01-21T13:40:03+00:00,Stock Faithful Try to Look Past Bond Market’s Sullen Signals,"(Bloomberg) -- A rousing Friday rally salvaged the week for tech investors but couldn’t undo damage done to the broader market by increasingly dour signals on the economy, many of them originating from bonds.

The 2023 surge in the S&P 500, spurred by speculation inflation is cooling, started showing cracks in the four-day week as focus shifted to prospects of an economic contraction. Anxiety that the Federal Reserve’s campaign of rate hikes has gone too far loom ever larger in the Treasury market, whose three-month trouncing of riskier assets reflects stiffening bets on a slowdown.

It’s not just fixed-income’s dour economic signal. Despite rallying to start the year, government bonds continue to represent legitimate competition to stocks in terms of valuation. A rough comparison of yields suggests the recovery in Treasury prices has room to run when viewed next to a still-expensive equity market.

None of that was enough to prevent Friday’s tech-led rebound, the biggest gain of the year for the Nasdaq Composite Index. The S&P 500 still suffered its first weekly decline of 2023, held back by losses on Wednesday and Thursday after reports on retail sales, producer prices and business equipment rekindled concern about the future of the economy.

“We believe that the S&P in particular is trading at valuations that are not appropriate with what we’re likely to see from earnings,” David Spika, president and chief investment officer of GuideStone Capital Management, said in an interview. “Bonds are still expensive, but relative to stocks, they’re much more attractively valued.”

The $32 billion iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond exchange-traded fund (ticker TLT) has climbed 6.7% in 2023 as investors seek safety in long-dated government securities, versus a 3.5% rise for the $365 billion SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY). That sets TLT up for a third straight month of outperformance relative to SPY, the longest winning streak since 2020.

Story continues

The long-dated bond ETF just logged a 50-day advance that topped 12.5% — something that in the past has occurred only when a recession is close at hand or fears over one are high, according to Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research. Over the past two decades, such a surge has happened in 2008-9 and also in 2020 when downturns were around the corner; it happened from 2010-2012, in 2015 and in 2019 when investors fretted over one, he found.

“Seeing +20-years rally by this amount is therefore not a fool-proof recession indicator, but it does say markets are concerned about an economic contraction,” he wrote in a note.

The S&P 500 fell 0.7% in the four days, paring its gain this year to 3.5%.

Even after 2022’s historical selloff, the so-called Fed model — which plots the S&P 500’s earnings yield against the yield on 10-year Treasuries — shows that bonds are still inexpensive compared to equities, at least by recent history. Relative to its price, the S&P 500 “pays out” roughly 5.2% in earnings, versus roughly 3.5% on the benchmark US bond. That’s close to the slimmest advantage for stocks in the past decade.

“Yields can come down quite a bit further despite the fact that they’ve come down quite a bit over the last couple of days, and it is an environment in which bonds are cheap again,” JPMorgan Asset Management global market strategist Meera Pandit said on Bloomberg Television. “The attractiveness of bonds going into the rest of 2023 has surged.”

Those early returns have revived the decades-old 60/40 investing approach after the twin selloffs in stocks and bonds last year produced the worst annual loss for the strategy since 2008’s financial crisis. Portfolios divided between 60% stocks and 40% bonds are enjoying their best start to a year since 1987, according to a Bloomberg Index.

The debt market’s dominance so far stacked against still-expensive equities has some portfolio managers advocating for a twist on the classic strategy: switch the components around and put most of the assets into bonds.

“The bond market is demonstrably cheap to the stock market,” DoubleLine Capital’s Jeffrey Gundlach said on a recent webcast hosted by his company. “I recommend not a 60/40 portfolio, but more like a 40/60 portfolio, or even a 60/25/15 portfolio — bonds, stocks and then other things in the 15%.”

Video Transcript

JARED BLIKRE: Here we have ourselves in the midst of a two-day decline. The losses range from the Dow about 57 basis points, or half a percent, to the downside, to the Russell 2000, 83 basis points or 8/10 of a percent. And I want to take a look at the VIX here. I haven't taken a look at that in a few days. And this is over the last six months. Over the last five, six, seven sessions or so, it has picked up a little bit. So we want to keep an eye on that, and that's in the midst of a selloff, at least a two-day selloff, as I said, with the S&P 500.

The NASDAQ really the most bearish-looking of the group, just kind of chopping around in the lower end of its range. Got to get to the bond market. Not a lot happening today after yesterday. Yesterday we saw some fireworks, that big drop in the 10-year to a four-month low. And today we were just bouncing up about two basis points, just a fractional move that we want to keep an eye on there.

Finally, the US dollar index, that is hanging out by its lows. Again, this is a six-month chart, so not making any ground recently, but not losing it either. So decent setup for risk markets potentially. Then we got real estate and healthcare in the green today. Those are the S&P 500 sectors, a little bit of a defensive setup. And then financials taking the biggest hit to the downside. That's XLF, down 1.2%, followed by industrials, materials, and consumer discretionary.

And just taking a look at our leaders, the top performer are going to be found in China. We'll take a look at that heat map in a second. And then the biggest losses can be found in TAN. That is a solar ETF, followed by Ark, cannabis, chip stocks, retail. So some of the biggest winners this year have been giving back those gains over the last two days. Easy come, easy go. I did promise to get to those bank-- the bank screen. Here, we have Capital One that's down 5 and 1/2%. We were looking at Discover earlier. That was down. Truist Financial, that is up 2.8%.

Easing inflation and hopes of the Fed’s slower rate hike path have been showing the fruition of that trend this year. SPDR S&P 600 Small Cap ETF SLY (up 7.0% this year) beat the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY (up 4.2%), SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust DIA (up 3.5%) and the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) (up 5.5%).

Americans too have regained confidence in the U.S. economy, with consumer confidence bouncing back in December and reversing consecutive declines in October and November to reach its highest level since April, per the University of Michigan's Consumer Confidence Index.

Investors must be interested in knowing small-cap stocks are shaping in the ongoing earnings season.  Per Zacks Earnings Trends issued on Jan 11, 2023, small-cap index S&P 600 are projected to record 13.5% drop in earnings over 0.7% gains in revenues. This is against the large-cap S&P 500 index’s likelihood of 7.6% fall in earnings over 4% increase in revenues.

Against this backdrop, below we highlight a few small-cap (S&P 600) sectors that are likely to post better earnings and revenue growth during the current earnings season than other sectors.

Sector ETFs in Focus

Basic Materials – Invesco S&P SmallCap Materials ETF PSCM

Per Zacks Earnings Trends issued on Jan 11, 2023, basic materials stocks in the S&P 600 are likely to log 49.5% earnings growth over 14% revenue growth for fourth-quarter 2022.

Oils & Energy – Invesco S&P SmallCap Energy ETF PSCE

Oils and energy stocks in the S&P 600 are likely to record 302.4% earnings growth over 36.0% revenue growth for fourth-quarter 2022.

Story continues

The 28-stock fund is heavy on Energy Equipment & Services (52.47%), followed by Oil, Gas & Consumable Fuels (47.49%). The fund charges 29 bps in fees. The fund’s top holdings include Helmerich & Payne (12.72%), SM Energy (9.69%) and Patterson-UTI Energy (8.99%). The fund has a Zacks Rank #2.

The 160-stock fund is heavy on Banks (39.54%), followed by REITs (27.9%). The fund charges 29 bps in fees. No stock accounts for more than 2.76%. The fund has a Zacks Rank #2.

163,2023-01-04T19:30:07+00:00,ETF Asset Report of December,"Wall Street was downbeat in December with muted Santa Clause Rally. The S&P 500 was off 5.7%, the Dow Jones has lost 3.7%, the Nasdaq Composite has retreated about 8.7% and the Russell 2000 has fallen about 7% past month (as of Dec 30, 2022).

In fact, the month snapped two consecutive months of gains. While recession fears were triggered by the relentless market forecasts, rising COVID cases in China and the advent of a new sub-variant of Omicron Covid-19 virus also contributed to the market slump.

Against this backdrop, below we highlight a few ETFs that fetched sizable assets in December.

Both Stocks & Bonds Win

Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF VTI amassed about $2.344 billion in Assets in the month whileiShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF AGG andVanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND) hauled in about $2.87 billion and $2.15 billion in assets, respectively in the month.

The benchmark U.S. treasury yield started the month at 3.53% while it ended the month at 3.88%. The yields seem pretty moderate given 4%+ yields recorded in 2022. As a result, both stocks and bonds probably have fetched investors’ attention.

Both Growth & Value ETFs Gain

iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF IWF and Vanguard Value ETF VTV fetched about $ 1.78 billion and $1.45 billion in assets in December, respectively. While moderate rates and a likelihood of slower Fed rate hikes in 2023 favored growth ETFs, value ETFs too gained assets because a stubbornly-high-rate-environment still prevails.

S&P 500 & Nasdaq-100 Fall Out of Favor

SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, iShares Core S&P 500 ETF IVV and Invesco QQQ Trust QQQ lost about $3.47 billion, $2.95 billion and $2.55 billion in assets, respectively.

TIPS ETFs Underperform Too

iShares TIPS Bond ETF TIP lost about $1.51 billion in assets. As inflation showed signs of easing, investors probably are not finding it a great bet right now. CPI jumped 7.1% year over year in November, down from a 7.7% year-over-year increase in October and a recent peak of 9.1% in June. This represents the lowest annual increase since late 2021. Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities ETF VTIP too lost about $845.6 million in assets.

Story continues

Short-Term Bond ETFs Fall Out of Favor

The monetary policymakers forecast that their key short-term rate will reach 5% to 5.25% by the end of 2023 before being slashed to 4.1% in 2024. That suggests that the Fed is prepared to hike its benchmark rate by additional three-quarters of a point and then stay put until the end of 2023.

This has probably cut demand for short-term bond ETFs like iShares 1-3 Year Treasury Bond ETF SHY lost assets worth $1.12 billion. PIMCO Enhanced Short Maturity Active ETF MINT and Vanguard Short-Term Corporate Bond ETF (VCSH) saw about $843.4 million and $777.4 million in assets gushing out of the funds.

Persistently high inflation, a hawkish Fed, Russia's invasion of Ukraine and a resurgence of COVID-19 cases in China weighed heavily on investor sentiment. The combination has sparked fears of a recession anytime soon.

SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, the proxy version of the S&P 500 Index, plunged about 18% last year. Despite the decline, some of the stocks in SPY’s portfolio have risen more than 40%. We have highlighted five stocks from different sectors that have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy or #3 (Hold) with positive estimated earnings growth for 2023. These are Hess Corporation HES, First Solar Inc. FSLR, Cardinal Health Inc. CAH, Arch Capital Group Ltd. ACGL and Lamb Weston Holdings Inc. LW.

Energy was the only top-performing sector in 2022, with 58% gains. This marks the best year on record for the energy sector. Factors like easing Omicron concerns, supply shortages and geopolitical tensions in Eastern Europe and the Middle East have boosted oil prices. Other sectors like utilities, consumer staples and healthcare lost 1.4%, 3.2% and 3.6%, respectively. The housing market has slowed down with higher mortgage rates, higher home prices, falling home sales and rising inventories (read: Energy ETFs Beat S&P 500 in 2022, More Gains Likely in 2023).

On the other hand, information technology, communication services and other high-beta sector were badly hit by sticky inflation and aggressive rate hikes from the Fed.The central bank has been on an aggressive tightening policy to fight the skyrocketing inflation. It has raised its interest rate by 475 bps this year in the fastest hikes since the 1980s and sent the benchmark interest rate to 4.25-4.50% - the highest level in 15 years. The central bank now projects at least a 75 bps rate hike, peaking at 5.1% by the end of 2023, 50 bps higher than the previously projected 4.6% back in September. The rate will then be cut to 4.1% in 2024.

The tech sector relies on easy borrowing for superior growth, and its value depends heavily on future earnings. A rise in long-term yields lowers the present value of companies’ future earnings, sparking fears of overvaluation.

Let’s take a closer look at the fundamentals of SPY.

SPY in Focus

SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust holds 503 stocks in its basket, with each accounting for no more than 6% of assets. This suggests a nice balance across each security and prevents heavy concentration. The fund is widely spread across sectors, with information technology, healthcare and financials accounting for a double-digit allocation each.

SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust has AUM of $353.5 billion and charges 9 bps in fees per year. The product trades in a heavy volume of around 72 million shares a day on average, ensuring higher liquidity with a tight bid/ask spread, leading to lower trading costs for investors. SPY has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a Medium risk outlook (see: all the Large Cap Blend ETFs here).

Below we have highlighted the above-mentioned five best-performing stocks in the ETF.

167,2022-12-29T13:00:01+00:00,ETF Asset Report of 2022 Q4,"Wall Street witnessed a mixed Q4 due to moderation in inflationary pressures, an expected slowdown in the pace of Fed rate hikes and ongoing geopolitical tensions in Russia and Ukraine. The S&P 500, the Dow Jones and the Russell 2000, gained 3.2%, 11% and 3.2%, respectively while the Nasdaq Composite fell 3.2% in the past three months (as of Dec 21, 2022).

As far as rates are concerned, the benchmark treasury yield started the quarter with 3.67%, hit a high of 4.24% and was at 3.68% at the end of Dec 21, 2022. Against this backdrop, below we highlight a few ETFs that fetched sizable assets in the fourth quarter of 2022.

S&P 500 ETFs Win

SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY and iShares Core S&P 500 ETF IVV amassed about $9.68 billion and $4.28 billion in the fourth quarter, respectively. Cheaper valuation probably lured investors to focus on the S&P 500 ETFs as risk-on sentiments returned to the market. Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI) also fetched in about $5.70 billion in assets in the quarter.

Tax-Exempt Bond ETFs Win

Vanguard Tax-Exempt Bond ETF VTEB and iShares National Muni Bond ETF MUB amassed about $6.07 billion and $3.70 billion in assets so far in the fourth quarter.

Long-Term & High-Yield Bond ETFs Were in Fashion

iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF TLT, iShares iBoxx USD High Yield Corporate Bond ETF HYG, SPDR Bloomberg High Yield Bond ETF (JNK) and Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND) hauled in about $4.59 billion, $4.43 billion, $3.74 billion and $3.65 billion in assets, respectively, in the ongoing fourth quarter.  As long-term rates gradually fell over the course of the fourth quarter, long-duration bond ETFs probably fetched investors’ attention.

TIPs Lost Assets

iShares TIPS Bond ETF TIP lost about $3.62 billion in assets while Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities ETF VTIP witnessed about $2.41 billion in assets gushing out of the fund. Inflation in the United States is cooling down gradually, underscoring that the worst of inflation has likely passed. CPI jumped 7.1% year over year in November, down from a 7.7% year-over-year increase in October and a recent peak of 9.1% in June. This represents the lowest annual increase since late 2021.

Story continues

Short-Term Bond ETFs Fell Out of Favor

The monetary policymakers forecast that their key short-term rate will reach 5% to 5.25% by the end of 2023 before being slashed to 4.1% in 2024. That suggests that the Fed is prepared to hike its benchmark rate by additional three-quarters of a point and then stay put until the end of 2023.

This has probably cut demand for short-term bond ETFs like iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF SHV and PIMCO Enhanced Short Maturity Active ETF (MINT). The funds SHV and MINT lost assets worth $3.34 billion and $2.22 billion, respectively.

Gold Lost Luster

SPDR Gold Trust GLD and iShares Gold Trust IAU too have seen assets worth of $1.29 billion and $1.57 billion gushing out of the fund. With inflation falling, gold could not live up to its status of an inflation-protected asset.

Known as the “SPDR Woman,” her death was confirmed by law firm Chapman and Cutler, where she was senior counsel in the firm’s New York office at the time of her death. Moriarty’s age and cause of death weren’t immediately available. She died after “a brief illness,” Reggie Browne, principal at GTS Securities in New York, told ETF.com.

Moriarty was tapped to help create a mutual-fund-style investment that traded on exchanges like a stock. That product, the SPDR S&P 500 Trust (SPY), launched in 1993 for State Street Corp. and is now the world’s biggest ETF, with $368 billion in assets.

Moriarty was mentioned in dozens of ETF.com articles and was named one of the publication’s “Legends of Indexing.”

Moriarty reflected on being one of the handful of women in the early days of the ETF industry in a recent podcast interview with ETF.com Managing Editor Heather Bell.

She said she was “fortunate” to work on several first-of-their-kind ETFs, including the first physical gold ETF and the first leveraged ETFs. Moriarty has also been an advocate for a bitcoin spot ETF.

In terms of strides women have made in the ETF industry, she said progress has been spotty, with more room for improvement.

“There are subtle [changes], I don’t think they are huge,” Moriarty noted.

She earned her law degree at Notre Dame Law School in 1980 and her undergraduate degree in 1975 from Smith College, according to Chapman’s profile. Moriarty was on numerous boards, including as a director of Women in ETFs, the New York Bar Association’s Investment Management Regulation Committee and the American Bar Association’s Task Force on Blockchain, Cryptocurrencies and Investment Management.

She received the Nate Most Award in 2017 as “Greatest Contributor to the ETF Marketplace.” The award is named after the inventor of the ETF.

In addition to helping create the SPDR Gold Trust (GLD), Moriarty was involved in the development of the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, the first attempt to register a bitcoin ETF in the U.S. by a U.S. applicant.

“The ETF industry wouldn’t be the same without her,” Browne said. “This is a great loss to her family and to the profession.”

You can skip our detailed analysis of the biggest American endowments and go directly to 5 Biggest Endowments in the US and Their Investments.

Biggest endowment funds in the US are in the academic sector. These are funds belonging to universities/colleges that they use for their short and long term goals, such as student aid, research, campus development and maintenance as well as teaching programs among others. The endowments’ principal sums mostly come from donations and fundraisings.

Academic endowment funds usually follow a fixed strategy of asset allocation that is in-line with their medium to long-term financial goals. The return target is usually a mean 7.5% to cover for expenses and inflation, according to Higher Ed Drive, a higher education news agency.

Moreover, specific spending guidelines underlie most university endowment funds. For instance, 4.5%-5% of the annual assets value is typical for many academic institutions.

Performance

Endowment funds had a relatively decent run in 2021, with returns averaging at 31%, outperforming the S&P 500 for the same year by 4%. In terms of five-year annualized returns, the endowment funds average out at 11.4%. In the fiscal year 2022 however, they were caught in the broader market downturn, averaging at -6%, according to Cambridge Associates.

The firm also noted that the 2022 loss was the worst for academic endowments since 2009, at a time when endowments are investing in moderate to high-risk assets like private equity to up their returns.

Endowments’ Hierarchy

In terms of the structure of academic endowment funds, 84% of $0.8 trillion of endowment wealth studied by The NACUBO is held by only 136 institutions, with the top three institutions accounting for $130 billion alone, as noted by Higher Ed Drive.

These include Harvard University, University of Texas System and Yale University, with Harvard claiming the largest share of the pie, at $50.9 billion. To single out Harvard’s endowment, it returned 33.6% in 2021, while posting a negative 1.8% in 2022, primarily driven by the ongoing stagflation. However, it fared far better considering the S&P 500 benchmark, with the index having a negative return of 13% so far in 2022.

Some of the prominent stocks in Harvard Management Company’s portfolio include NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG).

U.S. equity ETFs led the way higher with $5.2 billion in inflows, closely followed by $1.8 billion in U.S. fixed-income ETFs and $708 million in international equity ETFs, per etf.com.

As such, SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, Invesco QQQ Trust QQQ, Vanguard S&P 500 ETF VOO, iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF AGG and iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF IWF dominated the top creation list last week.

After a strong start to December, Wall Street struggled to find footing as bouts of solid economic data have dampened hopes for the Fed’s slower pace of rate hikes. The S&P 500 fell 3.4%, while the Dow lost 2.8% last week. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index declined 4%.

A stronger-than-expected November report on producer prices aggravated fears about the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes, following a stronger-than-expected November jobs report and a robust services sector report. The producer price index climbed 0.3% for the third month and was up 7.4% from a year ago.

The economy added 263,000 jobs in November, marking another strong month of job growth. The unemployment rate remained at 3.7%, close to a 50-year low, while average hourly earnings jumped 0.6% from the prior month and 5.1% from the year-ago month. Higher wages should add to inflation. Meanwhile, business activity jumped the most since March 2021 in November, suggesting that the largest part of the economy remains resilient. ISM’s gauge of services rose to 56.5 last month from 54.4 in October (read: 4 Sector ETFs to Play Upbeat November Jobs Data).

Investors continue to worry over Federal Reserve rate hikes and the prospect of a looming recession. The bouts of latest data — hotter-than-expected ISM services and stronger jobs — have put a damper on hopes that the Federal Reserve would ease the pace of its interest rate hikes amid recent signs of ebbing inflation.

What a difference a week makes.

Last Wednesday's Powell-fueled risk rally that landed the S&P 500 on top of its 200-day moving average for the first time since April has now been fully reversed and then some.

What was an upside breakout is now a failed upside breakout. A declining moving average ready to be rejected has again become a declining moving average that must be respected.

This, along with five straight days of declines in the S&P 500, now resets expectations about what Santa may or not deliver into year-end.

Sometimes in trading, patterns become obvious with hindsight — patterns that inform a host of woulda-coulda-shoulda trades which nearly perfectly reflect and predict price action over a period of time.

Along these lines, the CBOE Volatility Index — a/k/a the VIX — has provided a beautiful roadmap for trading the major indices in 2022.

A simple system emerges: buy the the S&P 500 when the VIX surges above the 35 level — indicating a relative amount of fear — and sell the S&P 500 when the VIX dips below 20, indicating relative complacency among investors. This year's ""easy"" trade seen only with hindsight.

And though the VIX tends to move inversely with the direction of the S&P 500, it's rare to see a mean-reverting pattern play out this cleanly over the arbitrary time frame of one calendar year.

In the context of a market that is shifting from one looking for excuses to move higher into a market looking for reasons to remain range-bound, this emerging VIX-to-S&P relationship makes sense.

Of course, it's not as though anyone could have (or would have) predicted on January 1, 2022 that this pattern would emerge. Or that this relationship would emerge at these particular levels. Sell at 20 and buy at 35 are retro-fitted thresholds in the VIX. In life and in markets, hindsight remains crystal clear.

Nevertheless, with the latest ""VIX sell"" signal becoming a confirmed winner, it makes sense to prepare for the next potential ""VIX buy"" signal that could emerge and think about how that plays out around some of the important levels in the S&P 500.

A surge in the VIX back above 35 after a bout of selling in the stock market would no doubt get the attention of traders and algos the world over. But there's no way to predict where the S&P 500 would be trading at that point, or how long it will take to get there.

However, by way of recent comparison, it took about six weeks for the VIX to travel from 20 to 35 the last go-around — during the market sell-off that ran from mid-August to early October — which would point to a potential buy early in the new year.

Failing any signal clarity with the VIX, the S&P 500 could flash a bullish signal by simply reclaiming its 200-day moving average to the upside. This would likely (but not necessarily) occur in confluence with a simultaneous close over its 2022 negative trend line (the red line in the first chart), which would strengthen the signal.

The U.S. dollar could also add clarity, but it simply continues to consolidate under its 200-day moving average after last week's breakdown.

All in all, it's looking like another waiting game for S&P 500 bulls as the latest signal melts into noise. Next week's inflation reads and Fed meeting might clear that up. Or just add volume to the current market broadcast.

182,2022-12-01T15:19:29+00:00,Investors Pull $8 Billion From Major Stock ETFs,"(Bloomberg) -- Exchange-traded fund investors took Wednesday’s stock-market surge as an opportunity to offload $8 billion of holdings in two of the biggest equity funds.

Investors pulled $5.8 billion from the $380 billion SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ticker SPY), marking the largest withdrawal since September. Meanwhile, the $162 billion Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ) saw an outflow of $2.1 billion, the biggest since July.

The withdrawals came just as the benchmarks the funds follow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100, rallied to 11-week highs on optimism that the Federal Reserve will pivot on interest rates. Sellers took advantage of the market’s recent show of strength as a string of jumbo rate hikes had been tamping down the stock market this year.

“Investors took advantage of the sharp rally in US equities and took short-term profits on large-cap strategies,” said Todd Rosenbluth, head of research at ETF data provider and research consultant VettaFi. “While 2022 has been a tough year, markets have bounced back in the fourth quarter on expectations the Fed would pivot. Investors often sell when there is greater confirmation of the market consensus.”

Combined outflows from the two mega funds total more than $11 billion so far this week, the most since February of 2020.

Among other closely watched equity funds, the $102-billion Vanguard Value ETF (VTV) saw a roughly $1.9 billion withdrawal Wednesday, capping November as its worst month ever for outflows, with more than $6 billion yanked.

Wednesday’s stock surge followed Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaling a likely slowdown in the pace of fiscal tightening could come as early as December.

Story continues

The central bank is trying to get rampant inflation under control and has been vocal about its need to continue to raise interest rates to achieve its objectives. Officials have signaled they plan to raise their benchmark rate by 50 basis points at their final meeting of the year on Dec. 13-14.

It’s possible that some investors reallocated from the big stock funds elsewhere, says Mohit Bajaj, director of ETFs at WallachBeth Capital. The flows could yet show up in other products since investors tend to use both SPY and QQQ as places to park their money temporarily.

But it’s also feasible that “a few people might be waiting until the next Fed announcement before making any other year-end moves,” he said.

U.S. equity ETFs led the way higher with $13.4 billion in inflows, closely followed by $9.2 billion in U.S. fixed-income ETFs and $3.9 billion in international equity ETFs, per etf.com.

As such, SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, iShares Core S&P 500 ETF IVV, iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF TLT, Vanguard Short-Term Corporate Bond ETF VCSH and iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF LQD dominated the top creation list last week.

Wall Street slumped last week as hawkish comments from Fed officials renewed worries over the aggressive rate hikes. The S&P 500 slipped 0.7% last week, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index tumbled 1.6%. Bets of a 75-bps hike at the Fed's next meeting from traders climbed to 19% from about 15% a day earlier, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.

Additionally, recessionary fears have resurfaced, leading to risk-off trading once again. Most of the decline came from the falling energy sector as renewed COVID-19 outbreaks in China and a weakening global growth outlook put pressure on oil prices. Further, China, which eased COVID restrictions a few days ago, might reinstitute some measures as infections ticked higher (read: Bet on China ETFs on a Solid Turnaround).

In the fixed-income space, the yield curve inverted further last week, marking the deepest inversion in over 40 years.

187,2022-11-15T18:45:00+00:00,Gold’s Performance Mixed in Year of High Inflation,"One of the most widely touted inflation hedges isn’t acting quite the way investors had hoped.

Gold ETFs like the SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) and the iShares Gold Trust (IAU) are down 3.6% this year, even as inflation runs at its highest level in close to four decades.

That’s a disappointing outcome for investors, who have responded by pulling $3.8 billion out of the top 10 gold ETFs since the start of the year.

Ticker Fund Inflows AUM GLD SPDR Gold Trust -$2,846.63M $50.27B IAU iShares Gold Trust -$1,808.99M $24.97B GDX VanEck Gold Miners ETF -$98.22M $10.78B GLDM SPDR Gold MiniShares Trust $911.39M $4.91B GDXJ VanEck Junior Gold Miners ETF -$165.15M $3.29B SGOL abrdn Physical Gold Shares ETF $13.43M $2.26B IAUM iShares Gold Trust Micro $218.81M $1.03B BAR GraniteShares Gold Trust $3.57M $852.25M OUNZ VanEck Merk Gold Trust $10.83M $554.58M AAAU Goldman Sachs Physical Gold ETF $7.98M $398.27M

Gold has been sold as a commodity that preserves its value against inflation, yet if it can’t rise in an extraordinary year for inflation like 2022, it calls into question that entire thesis.

On an inflation-adjusted basis, gold prices reached their recent peak in mid-2020. Since then, they lost a quarter of their value. The record inflation-adjusted high for gold prices was seen in 1980, when inflation reached double digits.

Still Outperforming

Gold bulls argue that this year’s modest decline in gold prices is a good showing for the precious metal in the context of the significant declines seen in financial markets. The gold spot price has dropped 4.4% this year, as measured by the IAU compared to a 16% drop in the S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY).

At their worst point, SPY and the iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF (AGG) were down by 24% and 16.6%, respectively, on a year-to-date basis.

Still, unlike stocks and bonds, gold offers investors no yield, and its value primarily comes from its aesthetic properties and the collective belief that it’s something that’s valuable.

Story continues

That conviction is still there, though it’s weakened in recent years as bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies entered the scene and stole some of gold’s appeal as a store of value.

Gold Up in Foreign Currencies

Gold advocates also argue that the gold market is global. While gold prices are down a little more than 2% this year in U.S. dollars, gold prices are up when translated into most other currencies.

In euros, gold is up around 6.6%; in pounds, it’s up 11.2%; and in yen, it’s up 17.9%. So anyone holding gold or gold ETFs outside of the U.S. is probably pretty content with their performance.

Still, gold has shown this year that it’s too inconsistent and volatile to be an inflation hedge. While you could make the case that it’s maintained much of its value over very long periods of time—multiple decades or even centuries—it doesn’t necessarily do so over the time periods investors care about: months, years or even a few decades.

A more reliable inflation hedge would be the Treasury inflation-protected securities you find in ETFs like the Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities ETF (VTIP), which compensate investors directly based on the consumer price index.

And for multiyear periods, you might as well invest in assets that can not only hold their value against inflation but grow their value against inflation—like stocks.

188,2022-11-15T18:00:06+00:00,What Lies Ahead of Dollar? ETFs in Focus,"The U.S. dollar is off almost flat in the three-month time period, up about 11.8% so far this year but lost 3.4% last week. The inflation data for the month of October came in softer-than-expected. The annual inflation rate in the United States decelerated for fourth month to 7.7% in October, the lowest since January, and below forecasts of 8%.

This led to an expectation that the Fed will pare down its pace of rate hikes. Traders expect the Fed to raise its benchmark lending rate in December but by a smaller margin of half a percentage point. As a result, the U.S. treasury bond yields fell. The U.S. benchmark treasury yield started the week at 4.17%, hit a high of 4.22% and ended the week at 3.82%.

However, the U.S. dollar recorded gains again to start this week as Fed Governor Christopher Waller on Sunday said the Fed may consider slowing the pace of rate increases at its next meeting but that should not be considered as a “softening” of its battle against inflation, per a CNBC article. Waller said markets should now pay attention to the “endpoint” of rate increases, not the pace of each move, and the endpoint is likely “a ways off.”

Hence, it all depends on inflation caused by supply chain issues. More than 40% of corporate decision-makers see a crucial need to overhaul their supply chains in 2023, with inflation, higher interest rates and weaker global trade posing threat to corporate profits, a new survey showed, per Business Standard. If such efforts can control price increases by corporates, inflation should cool down and Fed will also turn dovish.

Against this backdrop, below we do not expect the greenback to gain much strength ahead. Investors may wait and see and consider the below-mentioned ETF strategies if the greenback falls.

ETFs to Buy

Inverse Dollar Fund

Needless to say, if the dollar is rising, a short position on the currency would result in negative returns. Invesco DB US Dollar Index Bearish Fund UDN should thus be avoided.

Story continues

Commodities: Gold

The decline in the U.S. dollar is good for raw materials and commodities as these are priced in the U.S. dollar. SPDR Gold Shares GLD gained 5.6% last week due to a sudden dollar weakness.

Large Caps

Since large-cap stocks have greater foreign exposure, the strengthening dollar is negative for this capitalization. BofA Global Research once estimated that every 10% drop in the U.S. dollar translates into about a 3% boost to S&P earnings, as quoted on Reuters. SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY should thus be closely watched.

ETFs to Sell

U.S. Dollar

The dollar strength can sure be played with UUP and WisdomTree Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Bullish Fund USDU.

Dollar-Denominated Bond ETFs

Investors seeking EM exposure amid a falling dollar should not consider dollar-denominated EM bond ETFs. These funds invest in sovereign debt from a variety of emerging nations via U.S. dollar-denominated securities. Notably, the debt route is less risky than equities. Moreover, most emerging markets have low debt levels compared to the developed countries. Invesco BulletShares 2024 USD Emerging Markets Debt ETF BSDE is one such ETF. The fund yields 3.33% annually.

195,2022-11-08T18:00:06+00:00,ETF Asset Report of October,"Wall Street was upbeat in October, with the S&P 500 adding 7.9%, the Dow Jones gaining as much as 14%, the Nasdaq adding 1.6% and the Russell 2000 jumping 8.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has just logged its best month since 1976 in October.

Focus on value stocks, favorable sectoral exposure, oil rally and cheaper valuation helped the Dow Jones to attain this height. Speculation that the Fed may slow down the rate hike momentum from December and decent corporate earnings probably led to the return of risk-on sentiments.

Against this backdrop, below we highlight the asset report of October.

S&P 500 & Total Stock Market Top

The S&P 500 has amassed huge assets in October. Still, SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, iShares Core S&P 500 ETF IVV and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) added about $13.9 billion, $4.40 billion and $3.49 billion in assets in the month, respectively. Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF VTI has hauled in about $3.10 billion in assets. Cheaper valuation probably has lured investors to focus on the S&P 500 ETFs as risk-on sentiments returned in the market.

Investment Grade Corporate Bond & Junk Bond ETFs Win

iShares iBoxx USD Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF LQD hauled in about $3.66 billion while SPDR Bloomberg High Yield Bond ETF JNK has fetched about $3.14 billion in assets. As risk-on sentiments returned in the market, investors started betting big on corporate bond ETFs, both investment-grade as well as junk bonds.

Floating-Rate Bond ETFs Gain Assets

WisdomTree Floating Rate Treasury Fund USFR attracted about $2.30 billion in October.  Floating rate bonds are investment grade and do not pay a fixed rate to investors but have variable coupon rates that are often tied to an underlying index (such as LIBOR) plus a variable spread depending on the credit risk of the issuers.

Since the coupons of these bonds are adjusted periodically, these are less sensitive to an increase in rates compared to the traditional bonds. Unlike fixed coupon bonds, these do not lose value when the rates go up, making the bonds ideal for protecting investors against capital erosion in a rising rate environment.

Story continues

Tax-Exempt Bonds too in Favor

Vanguard Tax-Exempt Bond ETF VTEB has amassed about $3.44 billion in assets in October. The underlying Standard & Poors National AMT-Free Municipal Bond Index measures the performance of the investment-grade segment of the U.S. municipal bond market.

Nasdaq & ESG ETFs Fell Out of Favor

Invesco QQQ Trust QQQ and iShares ESG Aware MSCI USA ETF ESGU saw about $2.13 billion and $1.51 billion in assets gushing out, respectively. Both funds’ dependence on tech stocks probably led to this outflow. Tech stocks have been underperforming economically-sensitive sectors lately.

Gold Lost Its Glitter

As the greenback gained massive strength lately, gold prices underperformed. Gold is priced in the U.S. dollar. As rates have been rising in the United States and globally, non-interest-bearing assets like gold fell out of investors’ favor. The gold bullion ETFs iShares Gold Trust IAU andSPDR Gold Trust GLD lost about $1.1 billion and $996 million in assets.

199,2022-11-03T18:33:37+00:00,Traders scramble for protection after Fed spooks markets,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors rushed to guard against further declines in U.S. stocks on Thursday, a day after the Federal Reserve dashed hopes for a downshift in the central bank’s inflation-fighting rate hikes.

Trading in S&P 500 put options, typically used as a play in defensive positions, outnumbered calls, usually employed for upside wagers, 1.5-to-1 on Thursday afternoon, the most defensive the measure has been since mid-October, according to Trade Alert data.

The rush for protection comes after Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled that while interest rates may rise by smaller increments in the months ahead, the central bank will likely take its policy rate higher than previously expected to fight surging consumer prices.

The hawkish message was a disappointment to investors following a rally that saw the S&P 500 gain around 8% since mid-October through Tuesday on hopes that the Fed was close to a shift in the aggressive monetary policy that has bruised stocks this year. The index is down about 3% since Tuesday's close and is down around 22% so far in 2022.

""This caught a lot of people by surprise,"" said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. ""I am definitely seeing a bit more risk aversion to the downside.""

The more defensive tone of trading is in contrast with some bullish activity in the options market prior to the Fed meeting as investors worried about missing out on a rally.

On Thursday afternoon, with the S&P 500 index-tracking SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust's shares down 0.6% to $372.56, the most heavily traded SPY contracts were those that would guard against the ETF's shares slipping below $370 by Friday.

SPY puts expiring at the end of next week, struck at the $350 mark, just above the ETF's mid-October intra-day low of $348.11, were the fourth most actively traded SPY options on Thursday.

At the single stock level, near-term put options on battered megacaps such as Tesla, Amazon.com Inc and Apple Inc were among Thursday's most heavily traded contracts.

Story continues

While investors appear anxious about more near-term volatility, expectations for a big market crash remain muted. For instance, Nations TailDex, which measures the cost of hedging against a 3-standard deviation move in the SPY ETF, was on pace to close the session at a multi-year low, down sharply over the last six months.

Still, history suggests investors may have good reason to be wary.

""Recent 'Fed meeting volatility' has not necessarily been confined to the Fed day itself,"" Christopher Jacobson, a strategist at Susquehanna Financial Group, said in a note.

""Over the six prior Fed meetings year-to-date, the SPY has seen an average move of +/- 2.8% from the close on Wednesday (Fed day) to Friday's close,"" he said.

Though the Fed meeting is now in the rear view mirror, other events with the potential to roil markets lay ahead, including October's employment report, scheduled for release on Friday. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 200,000 in October.

Next week also brings the U.S. mid-term elections on Tuesday, with S&P 500 Index options implying a +/-2.9% move the day after the election, nearly double the index's daily average move this year, according to Goldman Sachs.

For now, ""the potential for divergent returns driven by the election is clearly underappreciated by the options market,"" the bank’s analysts wrote.

I liked the list I put together in October (and have positions in a couple), but I’m happy to have a second bite at the apple and give this list a revision. That’s because there are more than seven safe stocks, and more than one way to think about them.

One tried-and-true method is to look for best-in-class stocks. Long-term investments should consider buying the best and forgetting the rest. Sure there’s a place for a speculative stock or two in every portfolio. But over the long haul, most buy-and-hold investors are looking to lower their risk. A great way to do that is to buy stocks of companies that have consistent revenue and earnings.

And the way to find those stocks is by looking at companies that are among the leaders in their sector. That’s my focus for this article. So here are seven safe stocks to buy and hold for a solid long-term total return.

Safe Stocks to Buy and Hold: JPMorgan Chase (JPM) Chase Bank logo and storefront

Will they or won’t they? I’m talking about the Federal Reserve and its stance on interest rates. There are some that are suggesting that a slow-down, pause or even reversal may be in the offing. If you own JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), you really won’t have to care.

To begin with, JPMorgan Chase is the largest bank in the world. And that was on full display in the company’s third-quarter earnings report. The bank says that, for now, consumers and businesses are holding up well. And even if that situation changes, JPMorgan is well capitalized to hold up.

In the last month, JPM stock is up 20%, but the stock still has a P/E ratio of around 10.8x earnings. The bank is projected to post single-digit earnings growth over the next five years. And that’s backed up by a dividend with a yield of over 3% which should be more than enough to keep investors ahead of inflation which is likely to remain elevated for some time.

Most investors know that Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is one of the best-in-class stocks in the consumer staples sector. What they may not know is that some of the company’s most iconic brand names are about to become part of a separate company. J&J is preparing to spin off its consumer health division. The new company, which will be named Kenvue, will house products such as Tylenol, Band-Aid, and Johnson’s Baby Powder.

And when it does, it will be taking approximately 16% of the company’s total revenue. And that’s why JNJ stock didn’t get much of a lift from its earnings report. Investors are a little concerned about what the company’s earnings may look like.

But for long-term investors, J&J still appears to be a safe, low-beta stock that will continue to generate stable revenue and earnings. The company’s remaining medtech and pharmaceutical products divisions are only expected to show low single-digit earnings growth over the next five years, but the company has a solid dividend with a yield of over 2% to help boost investors’ total returns.

Safe Stocks to Buy and Hold: Coca-Cola (KO) Coca-Cola ko stock

Source: Mehaniq / Shutterstock.com

Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) falls in the consumer discretionary niche. But like McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD), the company is frequently looked at as a staple stock. Its products are in demand in any season through any macroeconomic condition.

And with the company’s size comes another advantage — pricing power. They can more readily pass along the cost to their consumers. That’s meaningful as the company is navigating higher costs due to inflation.

The company is cash rich with over $10 billion and is not hesitant to use that cash to the benefit of its shareholders. Coca-Cola is a dividend king having increased its dividend for each of the last 60 consecutive years. And while many investors prefer PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) because of its snack food division, Coke has taken strides to diversify its beverage offerings so it’s not as dependent on its flagship carbonated beverages which have fallen out of favor in recent years.

The housing sector is notoriously cyclical in nature. One way to maintain exposure to the sector in good times and bad is by investing in best-in-class home improvement stocks. And one of the giants in the sector is Home Depot (NYSE:HD).

The company was one of the first retailers in any sector to embrace the omnichannel model that has now become table stakes. Its embrace of digital technology was on full display during the pandemic and will keep it moving forward.

Some investors may be unsure about investing in home improvement stocks when the housing market is slowing down. But if homeowners can’t afford to move to a different home, they are likely to try and improve the one they have. That bodes well for a company that trades at a P/E of around 18.2X and has a healthy dividend yield of 2.57%.

Safe Stocks to Buy and Hold: Kraft Heinz (KHC) A photo of both the Kraft and Heinz logo

Going back to the consumer staples one more time brings me to Kraft Heinz (NYSE:KHC). I won’t deny that the last year hasn’t been rewarding for investors. But I’m talking about safe stocks to buy and hold for the long haul. This is where Kraft Heinz shines.

The company checks the boxes for things investors should look for in safe consumer staples stocks. Recognizable brands. Pricing power. A sound dividend. These are all important because many of the troubles the company faces come from supply chain concerns.

I can’t say when these issues are going to be resolved and whether they may get worse before they get better. But with my tongue firmly in my cheek, I will say that the issues are transitory and in the long term, KHC stock will be just fine.

Chart Industries (GTLS) Aerial drone photo of LNG (Liquified Natural Gas) tanker anchored in small LNG industrial islet of Revithoussa equipped with tanks for storage, Salamina, Greece.

If Chart Industries (NYSE:GTLS) is a new name for you, that makes two of us. But that’s what I love about the market. There are always some intriguing companies to discover. Chart Industries supplies equipment that’s needed to produce, store, and use industrial gases.

In 2022, that includes liquefied natural gas (LNG) as well as hydrogen. And this is a story that’s in the early innings which means buying GTLS stock today is a safe bet in the energy sector. In the first quarter of the year, the company reported record orders as well as a record backlog based largely on demand for LNG.

Unlike the other companies on this list, Chart Industries does not offer a dividend. However, I still consider it one of the safe stocks to buy and hold because it continues to grow revenue and earnings on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. This is a best-in-class company to keep on your watchlist and perhaps one that you should even consider taking a long position in.

Safe Stocks to Buy and Hold: Caterpillar (CAT) Image of a yellow construction vehicle with the Caterpillar (CAT) logo on it

Source: astudio / Shutterstock.com

Last on this list of safe stocks to buy and hold is Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT). The company just reported stellar earnings in late October. However, it’s what the company said about demand that has investors either confused or energized depending on where you stand.

Caterpillar stood to benefit from the infrastructure spending bill that passed Congress this past summer. That appears to be playing out at this time. Company executives said repeatedly on the call that it felt demand was strong. The company acknowledged that demand in the residential construction area was softening. However, it said that while they are monitoring the macroeconomic conditions, it still believes that demand remains strong.

Currently, CAT stock is bumping against its consensus price target. However, Caterpillar has received several price target increases since the earnings report. Furthermore, the company has an attractive P/E ratio of around 15X earnings and a dividend yield of over 2% that will reward investors for holding on even if a recession is on deck for 2023.

This has pushed year-to-date inflows to $496.2 billion. U.S. equity ETFs led the way with $26.5 billion in inflows, closely followed by $13.4 billion in U.S. fixed income and $2.9 billion in international equity, per etf.com.

As such, SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, iShares Core S&P 500 ETF IVV, SPDR S&P Dividend ETF SDY, SPDR Bloomberg Barclays High Yield Bond ETF JNK and iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF LQD dominated the top creation list last week.

While the slew of disappointing earnings from the big tech pushed the stock market lower, it remained resilient to end the week. The S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 notched their longest streak of weekly gains since August. Hopes of a less hawkish Fed and better-than-expected earnings outside the tech sector led to a rally in the stocks (read: 4 ETF Areas Up At Least 10% Last Week).

According to CME Group, traders have become more confident that the Fed will reduce its rate hike plans from three-quarters to half a percentage point at its December meeting. Many on Wall Street are expecting the Fed to pause its hikes or reduce its rate hike size in the near future.

In fact, the Dow Jones Industrial Average wrapped up the best month since 1976.

We have detailed the ETFs below:

ETFs or exchange traded fund are pooled investment securities which often track a particular index or sector. Given that many ETFs have lower fees than mutual funds and the securities can often be more liquid, the popularity of ETFs have increased substantially over the past ten years.

With some of the most popular ETFs such as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), investors can also get diversification fairly easily and also tax efficiency. Vanguard, one of the leading ETF issuers in the world, explains the tax efficiency of ETFs,

""Because ETFs trade on exchanges much like the way individual stocks do, the vast majority of trading in ETFs takes place between investors on the secondary market, with no impact on the ETFs' underlying securities. A much smaller share of ETF trading occurs on the primary market, where ETFs create or redeem shares through transactions with financial institutions known as authorized participants. For most primary market transactions, ETF shares are exchanged for a basket of securities rather than cash. Such ""in-kind"" transactions are not considered taxable events and thus also contribute to ETFs' tax efficiency.""

Although there are times when ETFs may occasionally distribute capital gains that could be taxable depending on the investment account, many ETFs are generally tax efficient.

Top ETFs in the World

In terms of the top ETFs in the world, many of the top ETFs in the world are either equity ETFs or bond ETFs that focus on the broader U.S. economy or on a basket of larger companies based in the United States.

Although the United States faces headwinds like many other nations, the U.S. is arguably still one of the best places to invest in the world. The U.S. economy is the largest economy in the world and many of its companies are very technologically innovative. The country has a highly educated workforce and great infrastructure. With the U.S. dollar still the reserve currency of the world, the U.S. enjoys many advantages that other nations don't. The country also has great geography and substantial natural resources.

2022 Headwinds

The S&P 500 soared after the United States economy rebounded from the pandemic recession and as the Federal Reserve continued its supportive monetary policy up until the beginning of 2022. Many equity ETFs that tracked the S&P 500 also benefited from the rally.

Given 2022's Ukraine Russian war as well as the strong inflationary pressures outside of energy prices, however, the Federal Reserve has had to tighten its monetary policy with five rate hikes this year so far. Given that higher interest rates could potentially reduce demand, the S&P 500 has fallen around 21% year to date as of October 24 and the NASDAQ has declined around 31% year to date. As a result, many equity ETFs that track either the S&P 500 or the NASDAQ has fallen substantially year to date.

While there could be headwinds in the near term, the S&P 500 index still likely has substantial upside in the next decades as the U.S. economy is expected to continue to grow. Best Things to Do in NYC During COVID-19

BRAD SMITH: Welcome back to ""Yahoo! Finance Live,"" everyone. We are about 10 minutes into the start of trading here on this Friday. Let's get on over to Jared Blikre at the YFi Interactive with more on what's playing out early in today's session. Jared.

JARED BLIKRE: Yeah, let's take a look at the major indices here. Everything in the green so far. It's been a choppy week. And we'll take a longer term look in just a second.

Here is the five-day price action. You can see after that nice rise Monday, Tuesday, just been chopping around and kind of flagging here. And the other indices look pretty much the same.

So I'm gonna expand this to a longer term view of the S&P 500 over the last six months. And this rally, this fledgling rally that we have right here, looking a lot like this rally that we had in July. We took out these highs here, just like we took out these highs here. And we're just consolidating.

Are we going to get a squeeze higher, like we did in August, late July? We'll have to see. We do have mutual funds closing their books. Their year-end in a few days. They do some tax loss harvesting. So end of month could actually be important here. We'll have to see what comes of that.

Just want to point out that volatility is still coming down. That's the VIX. And also over the last six months, we can see the VIX of the VIX, that is the third derivative of equities here, that is actually at the lows that we've seen in August. So volatility coming down. Also in bonds. And then we also see the US dollar. Now, that is on the rise. That is a potential headwind to the market.

But before I go, I just want to show you what's happened inside the market. Here is tech. That is the biggest gainer today, followed by communication services, staples, utilities. Now, take a look inside the NASDAQ. Now, we have a lot of green on the screen. Apple now up 4%. Amazon down 9%.

I'm gonna leave you with a market cap view. Check this out, Amazon $1.024 trillion. Hasn't sunk below that just yet. But lots to say about the mega caps this week, guys.

210,2022-10-24T19:30:00+00:00,Risky ETFs Drawing Investors Amid Elusive Profits,"Risky exchange-traded funds are drawing investors seeking profit in a tumbling market, and at least one analyst finds the trend alarming.

Investors have poured nearly $25 billion into leveraged and inverse ETFs this year, up 47% from the $17 billion that flooded in at the start of the 2008 financial crisis, Morningstar Direct data shows. The inflow into leveraged and inverse ETFs represents 6.1% of the more than $403 billion the ETF industry brought in this year, versus the 1% the sector saw 2021.

The investment vehicles differ greatly from traditional ETFs, and are often used for shorter duration trades. Inverse funds move counter to their underlying index, and, like leveraged funds, sometimes use borrowed capital to magnify wins. Analysts caution the strategy can also increase losses.

“These are ETFs that investors should never really touch,” said Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research for the North American arm of Morningstar Research Services. The overwhelming increase in assets into these funds could be attributed to the “buy the dip” mindset, he added.

Still, as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq have lost more than 20% year to date; inflation remains at highs unseen for decades; and central banks across the globe deliver historic rate hikes, investors are searching esoteric bets for returns.

Some inverse and leveraged funds are doing exactly that, with the ProShares UltraPro Short QQQ (SQQQ), the ProShares UltraPro Short S&P500 (SPXU) and the Direxion Daily S&P 500 High Beta Bear 3X Shares (HIBS) up more than 92%, 60% and 30% year to date, respectively, according to ETF.com data. Meanwhile, typical index-tracking funds, such as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ), are yielding lows akin to their underlying indices.

“The odds are stacked against these types of funds,” Armour said, pointing to increasing market volatility. “The winners in these products are going to be market makers and the professional issuers and such, not investors.”

Story continues

“They're expecting sort of a rebound or to take advantage of short term,” he added, referring to investors. “Short-term bull markets do occur. But it's a lot easier to look back at a chart and say, ‘buy here, sell there’ than it is to know when to buy and sell without seeing the future.”

Wednesday, October 20, 2022

Today's newsletter is by Jared Blikre, a reporter focused on the markets on Yahoo Finance. Follow him on Twitter @SPYJared. Read this and more market news on the go with Yahoo Finance App

The volatility on Wall Street continued on Wednesday, this time to the downside. U.S. stocks closed in the red, eating into the prior two days' gains.

While the small-cap Russell 2000 index declined the most — down 1.7% — it has outperformed the major indices recently. This performance has caught the attention of Wall Street, which is laser-focused on the impacts of the strengthening U.S. dollar and surging Treasury yields.

Both of those factors likely led to Wednesday's decline in U.S. stocks. Small-cap companies — which generally have market capitalizations of less than $2 billion — tend to be less affected by currency fluctuations than larger cap companies. The stronger dollar is less likely to take a toll on these companies, as smaller caps are more likely to do business in the U.S. rather than overseas.

While the Russell 2000 index sold off sharply from mid-August to early October with the other averages, it didn't break down through its June low, while the so-called major averages did.

The Russell bottomed on Sept. 26 — putting in its most recent low — days ahead of the Dow and two weeks ahead of the lagging Nasdaq.

This relative outperformance by small caps is catching the attention of Wall Street because, as Liz Young, head of investment strategy at SoFi, pointed out in a tweet, ""small-caps have outperformed large-caps coming out of recessions 6 out of the last 6 times (all that we have data for).""

Wall Street might debate whether we're in a recession, but it's undeniable that many stocks have declined this year. Until larger cap stocks stop making lower lows, small caps are looking like the better play and have the potential to lead the general market higher.

213,2022-10-19T17:27:44+00:00,7 Semiconductor Stocks to Buy When the Chips Are Down,"Stock markets treat semiconductor stocks to buy as a leading indicator of the health of the technology sector.

In 2022, the bear market sent iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) down by 44.93%. By comparison, the widely followed S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) lost 24.70%. The semiconductor sector’s steep under-performance spells trouble ahead. Chip companies are already cutting back on what is normally heavy spending on capital expenditures.

Chip firms are bracing for softness that began earlier this year to continue for the rest of 2022. Chips are down because markets are betting that demand for semiconductors will persist into 2023. This speculation is too bearish.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Chips power everything from smartphones, computers and electric vehicles, to centralized servers. Demand for data storage, wider communications bandwidth, and computing problems will not slow.

Aggressive investors need to include semiconductor stocks to buy in their growth portfolio. The slowdown may continue for a brief quarter or two. Eventually, consumer spending will rebound as the economy improves.

Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) is one of the semiconductor stocks to buy on weakness. The company cut its fourth-quarter net sales by around $400 million, explaining that the United States export regulation on chips sold in China will hurt revenue.

Applied will pursue additional export licenses and authorizations. Sales will decline again by $400 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Fortunately, the market priced in the impact of the new regulations.

The chip giant benefits from the strong demand exceeding supply. For example, president and CEO Gary Dickerson met with top chief executive officers. The leaders agreed that the company cannot supply enough to meet demand.

In the longer term, Applied has billions in investments ready. It positioned the company to prepare for major positive inflections ahead.

Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) will reportedly cut thousands of jobs. It needs to align costs with the slowdown in the personal computer market.

Unfortunately, the company will not need as much marketing and sales efforts to chase weaker demand in end markets. During the pandemic, customers and corporations bought computers to support working from home.

The PC upgrade cycle started during the 2020-2021 pandemic. Now it needs to pivot beyond selling central computing chips. Late last month, Intel said that Moore’s law is not dead. In effect, CEO Gelsinger’s reference to the law ushered Intel’s entry into mainstream graphics cards.

Intel’s GPU could not come sooner. GPU suppliers are offering minimal discounts on the mid-range card. Consumers may buy Intel’s Arc A770 GPU for $329. The GPU will compete with the Nvidia 3060 Ti.

Since this model is in limited supply, Intel may sell its product at a better price. Strong demand for the new GPUs makes INTC one of the best semiconductor stocks to buy for the long term.

Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) raised its dividend by 15% to $0.225 a share in its last quarterly payment. The company intends to increase dividends annually., making it one of the semiconductor stocks to buy for regular income.

Although the stock dividend of 2.19% does not compare to Intel’s 5.63% dividend yield, Lam Research has strong growth prospects today.

The chip sector has been working through a supply chain disruption for around nine months. Lam Research believes the strong NAND market will lift its results.

Layer counts are increasing. As Lam deposits more films on the wafer, it increases the time to output. The denser product should sustain profit margins. Furthermore, the company is investing in its business to maintain its competitive edge.

In December, the company will issue its guidance for 2023. The memory chip market will weaken. Still, price declines for memory will help clear the excess supply.

In addition, the industry will invest less in factories. This gives LRCX stock a boost. The company will enable new node conversions. This should help the company beat expectations.

Marvell (MRVL) image of the marvell (MRVL) technologies office campus

Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL) posted record revenue of $1.52 billion in its Q2/2023 report.

Marvell benefits from healthy demand for its products. All but consumer hard drive disk drive demand is outpacing supply. In addition, Marvell has new products ahead. This should support its long-term growth prospects.

The cloud-optimized silicon development is a growth opportunity for the company. It has new design wins that it achieved in the last few years. This will add $400 million in revenue next year. The year after that, Marvell will earn $800 million in incremental revenue.

In the 5G business, strong adoption will fuel the company’s growth. In the automotive segment, customers require Ethernet solutions. Top automotive OEMs require Marvell’s technology. Fortunately, customers require the designs in both gas-powered and electric vehicles.

Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) recently launched a powerful graphics card for the high-end gamer.

Retailers are pricing the RTX 4090 card between $1,599 and $1,699. The $100 price above the suggested retail price suggests that the product enjoys strong market demand.

At the time it announced the 4090, Nvidia announced an RTX 4080 12GB. At a glance, the product looked like it had less memory than the RTX 4080 16GB. Experts noticed the performance difference and criticized the product name. Nvidia listened. It will “unlaunch” the product and will relaunch it at a later date.

The company is likely producing limited units of a high-end product. It wants the market to sell out of the current RTX 30 series first.

Nvidia’s revenue warning sent NVDA stock lower. It expects revenue will fall by around $5 billion. The firm revised its growth outlook. It did not see a strong back-to-school demand bump. The weak sales may continue this holiday. Investors should consider accumulating shares as the company works down the excess inventory.

Qorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO) is heavily reliant on smartphone sales. High inflation rates are hurting consumers’ disposable income. If they delay iPhone upgrades, it would hurt Qorvo, which depends on 33% of its sales from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).

Investors may take advantage of the lower price-to-earnings multiples on QRVO stock. It is a diversified firm. For example, it has diversification in growth product areas.

The cellular market benefits from multiyear content and integration. In connectivity and sensing, Qorvo’s portfolio has multiple connectivity standards. This includes Matter, Wi-Fi, and ultra-wideband.

Markets overlook Qorvo’s high-performance analog segment. Instead of appreciating the upgrade cycle and 5G infrastructure growth, stock traders react to its stock price.

Qorvo will navigate past the macrocosmic headwind by continuing its design efforts. It will increase volume output as the supply conditions strengthen. Investors may time the low point in its business. The Android business is weakest during the December quarter.

Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) is a highly profitable manufacturer. It posted gross margins of 60.4% in its Q3 report. Free cash flow is very strong. Markets refuse to acknowledge the business strength. TSM stock is down by 50% year to date.

In 2023, TSM expects challenges from higher depreciation costs, higher inflationary costs, and unfavorable semiconductor cyclicality. Still, its overseas fab expansions are long-term investments that benefit the company’s health. The company will closely work with its customers to support them strategically. Internally, it will find ways to improve costs.

TSM is cautious about the PC and smartphone market. The market’s softness in the quarter weighed on results. Utilization will be under pressure. During that time, it will work with customers to develop radio frequency and connectivity solutions. This increases TSM’s addressable market.

After customers will work through weak demand, TSM’s utilization will recover. Investors should consider buying a small position before that happens.

214,2022-10-18T16:30:00+00:00,State Street 3Q ETF Outflows Soar to $14B,"State Street Corp.’s exchange-traded fund division was hammered by soaring third-quarter outflows as volatility in fixed income and equity markets curbed investor enthusiasm.

The third-largest U.S. ETF issuer reported $14 billion in net outflows in ETFs, a reversal from the $13 billion pulled in during the same period last year. Earnings per share fell to $1.80 for the Boston-based firm from $1.96 a year earlier. Still, the figure beat FactSet’s aggregated analyst expectations of $1.78. Shares of the company fell nearly 2% to $62.60 during midday trading.

Big ETF issuers have reported a mixed bag of results this quarter. Charles Schwab Corp. this week reported revenue from ETF sales fell 10%, and also announced declining assets under management and fee revenues. BlackRock Inc., the largest ETF issuer, said its iShares unit helped lift earnings per share, while at the same time inflows dropped by more than half to $22 billion from the year-earlier quarter.

Equity-focused ETFs at State Street, which manages 141 U.S.-traded ETFs, performed the worst in the quarter among that issuer’s asset classes, with $9 billion in outflows. Alternative investments reported $7 billion in losses, while fixed income funds brought in $2 billion.

The lackluster performance was “largely due to lower equity and fixed income market levels,” Chief Executive Officer Ronald O’Hanley said on an earnings call with analysts Tuesday.

The S&P 500 has fallen 22.8% year to date. Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark 10-year note has topped 4% for the first time since 2008 following hard-to-tame inflation and consequent moves from the Federal Reserve. Yields rise as bond prices fall.

Among the U.S.-based funds with the greatest outflows in the third quarter are the SPDR Gold Trust (GLD), the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and the SPDR Blackstone Senior Loan ETF (SRLN), which collectively lost $9.7 billion in assets, according to ETF.com data. Significant outflows were also seen from a low-yielding Asia-Pacific fund, according to an earnings statement.

Meanwhile, management and fee revenues also fell. State Street announced an 8% decline in fee revenue, with segments like servicing and management fees decreasing 12% and 10%, respectively.

215,2022-10-18T14:05:02+00:00,5 Most-Loved ETFs of Last Week,"Last week, ETFs pulled in about $17.6 billion in capital, pushing year-to-date inflows to $440.4 billion. U.S. equity ETFs led the way with $11.8 billion inflows, closely followed by $3 billion in U.S. fixed income and $1.9 billion in international equity, per etf.com.

As such, SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, iShares U.S. Treasury Bond ETF GOVT, Vanguard Tax-Exempt Bond ETF VTEB, Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF VTI and iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF TLT dominated the top creation list last week.

Wall Street saw wild swings last week, with the major indices moving in opposite directions. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.1% in the week, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 1.5% and 3.1%, respectively. After a powerful rally at the start of the week, the stocks lost momentum on hot inflation data, which would push the Federal Reserve toward another aggressive rate hike. And investors used a pullback in stocks to pick up some of their favorite ETFs.

The core consumer price index, which strips out volatile components, such as food and energy prices, climbed 6.6% year over year, marking the biggest annual increase in 40 years. The consumer price index rose 0.4% in September after rising 0.1% in August, twice the 0.2% projected by analysts, even as the annual rate slowed slightly to 8.2% from 8.3% (read: 4 Sector ETFs to Tap on Rising Inflation).

The hot data came amid soaring prices for shelter, food and medical care and pushed up chances of the Federal Reserve’s fourth 75 bps interest rate hike next month. Following the data, the S&P 500 climbed more than 5% from its intraday lows on Oct 13 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 1,500 points from its intraday lows to the highest level, falling more than 500 points and then rose at least 800 points

Meanwhile, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yields soared above 4% last week while the U.S. dollar index neared 20-year highs after the data cemented the view of more rate hikes.

We have detailed the ETFs below:

SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY)

SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust topped asset flow creation last week, gathering $4.6 billion in capital.

219,2022-10-04T17:00:05+00:00,ETF Asset Report of September,"The month of September stuck to its ill-repute. The S&P 500, the Dow Jones, the Nasdaq Composite and the Russell 2000 lost about 8.6%, 8.3%, 9.1% and 8%, respectively, in past one month (as of Sep 30, 2022). The key reasons for such underperformance were the Fed’s indication that it will continue its steep rate hike momentum to contain inflation despite the economic growth concerns.

Against this backdrop, below we highlight the asset report of September.

Ultra-Short Term Treasury Bond ETFs Won

SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 Month T-Bill ETF (BIL), iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF (SHV), iShares 1-3 Year Treasury Bond ETF SHY and iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF (SGOV) hauled in $6.13 billion, $3.82 billion, $2.23 billion and $1.49 billion in assets, respectively.

The short-term corner of the Treasury market has been an area to watch lately, given the stock market turmoil. As such, the appeal for cash-like ETFs has been on the rise as investors seek to mitigate the risk of a decline in the stock market. Short-term bond ETFs have low-interest-rate risks.

S&P 500 In Toppers’ List

SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, Vanguard S&P 500 ETF VOO and Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF VTI amassed about $1.52 billion and $3.87 billion in assets in September. Though the broader market was downbeat, equity investors probably used the buy-the-dip strategy. Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF VTI and iShares Core S&P Total U.S. Stock Market ETF (ITOT) too amassed about $1.93 billion and $2.15 billion in assets, respectively.

Floating Rate Bond ETF: A Winner

WisdomTree Floating Rate Treasury Fund USFR too fetched about $1.41 billion in assets in September. The underlying Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Floating Rate Bond Index is a rules-based, market value-weighted index engineered to measure the performance of floating rate U.S. Treasury bonds.

As the Fed is planning to hike rates faster to combat sky-high inflation, demand for floating rate bonds gained. Since the coupons of these bonds are adjusted periodically, they are less sensitive to an increase in rates compared with traditional bonds.

Story continues

Junk Bonds & Corporate Bonds Out of Favor

As safe U.S. treasury bond yields shot up in September, investors’ inclination toward junk bonds fell. These bonds are of lower credit quality and may underperform (or default) if the economy slips into prolonged recession. iShares iBoxx USD Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF LQD andSPDR Bloomberg High Yield Bond ETF JNK lost about $3.68 billion and $2.29 billion in assets, respectively.

Vanguard Short-Term Corporate Bond ETF VCSH andVanguard Intermediate-Term Corporate Bond Index Fund ETF (VCIT) witnessed about $1.32 billion and $1.21 billion in assets slipping through the products, respectively.

Financials Fell

Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund XLF lost about $3.5 billion in assets as the yield curve flattened in the month.

Gold Lost Its Glitter

As the greenback gained massive strength lately, gold prices underperformed. Gold is priced in the U.S. dollar. As rates have been rising in the United States and globally, non-interest-bearing assets like gold fell out of investors’ favor. The gold bullion ETF GLD lost about $1.72 billion in assets.

Video Transcript

[AUDIO LOGO]

SEANA SMITH: Once again, today, we're back in the red, the S&P hitting a new low for the year. What's ahead?

THOMAS HAYES: Well, you know, first off, we're in a period of seasonal weakness. So September is the worst month of the year, and this happens to be the worst week of the worst month of the year. So there's max pessimism. It does remind me a bit of June when we were coming into earnings season. There was max pessimism, estimates were-- expectations were extremely low.

We have a very similar situation right now. Earnings growth is expected to be just 3.2% for Q3. Prices have doubled more than that. So you're effectively looking at negative earnings growth, and the economy just doesn't look like it's going to go that way. So it sets up for a positive surprise into year-end.

We're also going into the election. And the likelihood based on the data is that there's going to be gridlock after November 8. That, too, can be bullish for the stock market. It means no new taxes. It means no new regulation. And the market likes that. Regardless of who's in the executive branch, it's good to have gridlock. The less that gets done, the more Wall Street likes it.

DAVID BRIGGS: Looking like the Republicans take the House and Democrats hang on to the Senate, all this pessimism going around, do you share it?

THOMAS HAYES: I don't. I look at the way managers are positioned. We've got the highest cash levels since the pandemic lows, since March of 2009, since the tech wreck. Usually when things get to this level of extremes, it's a market turning point, and we just don't know what that catalyst is going to be.

What I have seen is central banks around the world blinking. So the ECB, they came out with that facility to buy Italian bonds on the periphery. You saw Bank of England have to buy gilts. And the question is, when is the Fed going to be next? And the key thing here we have to keep in mind, Chair Powell has this idea that he wants to be Paul Volcker. The difference between Paul Volcker and today is when Paul Volcker was raising rates, the debt-to-GDP was at 30%. Today, we're at 122%.

Story continues

So for every 1% he increases the Fed funds rate, that adds $285 billion to the deficit, so it becomes unsustainable. And sooner or later, like all politicians, they get disciplined by the credit markets. And when municipalities and companies have to refinance and the government has to refinance and the interest costs become unsustainable, they'll have to back off.

We've just come off of three emergency hikes of 75 basis points. In the last-- since 1983, you've had about 88 hikes. 75 of them were below 50 basis points. So what we've done is pretty material, and we have to kind of just take a pause and see how that works.

RACHELLE AKUFFO: And as we sort of wait for some of the things-- these things to work their way through the real economy, Tom, what looks attractive to you right now? A lot of people are wondering if the Fed risks overtightening.

THOMAS HAYES: There's no question they risk overtightening, that's for sure. One of the groups that we like that's kind of less sensitive to the interest rates, although people think it is sensitive, is biotech. In the last tightening cycle we had, in anticipation of it, the biotech group dropped about 50% from 2015 to early 2016. Over the next two years while the Fed was increasing the Fed funds rate from basically 0 to 250, you saw that group recover about 130% off the lows.

We're seeing the two key catalysts start to work out. That is major deal activity we've seen since May-- it cooled off a little bit in the fall with rates-- and major drug activity, yesterday being the biggest with Biogen. That's huge for Alzheimer's.

And we're going to see more investment and more excitement come into the sector that has been really left for dead and very few people are focused on right now. Despite the 56% move off the May lows, we're now consolidating. I think, as you look out over the next one to two years, Rachelle, there's opportunity there.

SEANA SMITH: Tom, what do you make of what's been happening in the tech sector and the selling that we're seeing there? Once again, we're seeing a lot of these larger-cap tech names lead to the downside today. Apple, Amazon, Meta, Google among the worst performers in today's market. What's it going to take to stop some of the bleeding there?

THOMAS HAYES: Yeah, it really is a function of rates, and it really is going to be a question of when the Fed blinks. And what we need to see is some better inflation data. We need to see employment cooling. This morning didn't help, but we'll see the jobs report coming up real soon.

And once you see some stabilization in rates and the dollar-- one of the key things that I look at, Seana and Dave, is the weekly Commitments of Traders report. And I look at the commercial hedgers because they're always right and they're always early. And what we're seeing is the commercial hedgers are the most short the dollar that they've been in a long time.

They're most long the 10-year Treasury than they've been in a long time. And they're long S&P futures. They've been right. And if you look at the last five peaks and troughs for those instruments, it's always preceded major market turns. So I don't know if it's in the next two days or the next two weeks, but I think within the next two months is realistic.

And I would say if you're going into the end of the year excessively pessimistic, there's really no one left to sell. The National Association of Active Investment Managers today came in at 12.86% equity exposure. They were at 11% at the pandemic lows when we didn't know if we'd have a vaccine for four years.

So I look at things, active investment-- the Association of Individual Investors at 20% bullish, that's consistent with pandemic lows, great financial crisis lows. And I really don't think we're in a situation like the pandemic where the uncertainty was that high or like the Great Financial Crisis where banks were in a bad shape. Banks are in very good shape right now.

DAVID BRIGGS: The action in the 10-year, we mentioned it earlier. What's it telling you is around the corner?

THOMAS HAYES: Well, you know, it's pricing in that the Fed is going to keep going on autopilot. And the last time we heard autopilot was December of 2018 when Powell came in and made his first mistake of three major mistakes and crashed the market 16 and 1/2% within a couple of weeks. Right before Christmas, Mnuchin had to call up six banks and get a liquidity line.

Five days later, a Chair Powell backtrack. He walked back his language on that autopilot. Within three months, we were at new market highs. Last year when inflation was at 4%, GDP estimates were at 3.8% for this year, they thought 10 basis points made a lot of sense and inflation was transitory. Now that GDP is at 0.2%, collapsing, inflation is coming down, they think 4.6% makes a lot of sense.

It's like a dog chasing its tail. They're working-- they're forgetting about the lagged effect of monetary policy. And I think the credit markets will let them know very, very quickly. Just like Bank of England, they will walk back or they will pause, and that will be very, very bullish for equities, including tech.

RACHELLE AKUFFO: And, Tom, as you look at some of the stickier parts of inflation, when do you expect those to start subsiding?

THOMAS HAYES: Yeah, that's going to take some time. If you look at-- post World War II was the last time we had debt-to-GDP this high, over 120%. And what they basically did was they talked hawkish and they act dovish, very similar to what they're doing today. And they did run inflation above trend about 3% to 5% over the five years following World War II. And what you saw was debt-to-GDP drop from 120% down to 63% in just a handful of years by running inflation above trend.

The key thing about the Fed where they've been right is that hawkish talk has brought down five-year inflation break evens from 359 in March to 237 yesterday. So they're anchoring those long-term expectations. They are succeeding with the language. Now they just need to ease up a little bit on the action. They've gone a little bit too much the last three hikes is you might kill the patient with too much medicine.

DAVID BRIGGS: Let that medicine work--

THOMAS HAYES: Exactly.

DAVID BRIGGS: --right, man?

THOMAS HAYES: I'm with you, Dave.

DAVID BRIGGS: Keep beating that drum, Tom. Hey, it's good to have you here in the studio.

In the summer of 2022, the absence of negative news propelled the S&P 500 (NYSE:SPY) to erase some earlier losses.

On Sept. 13 the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics posted a consumer price index of 8.3%. The energy index fell by 5% over the month. However, core inflation increased. Last week, the Fed announced it would raise rates by 75 basis points. It is steadfast in triggering a recession and job loss. The economy may withstand increased unemployment.

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) fell into a downtrend ahead of its desktop processor refresh announcement. After it announced the fastest core in gaming with the Ryzen 7000 series, AMD stock fell further.

Alongside its Zen 4 generation refresh is the update in its server portfolio. AMD’s Genoa has 96 cores in power for the data center. Cloud computing applications will benefit from this power. Bergamo has even more computing power. It has up to 128 cores and supports high-demand workloads in the cloud computing space.

The total addressable market for 128-core server systems is growing. Unlike desktop computers, where consumers want 4 GHz or 5 GHz in power, servers are power constrained. AMD has highly efficient solutions that the market needs. Corporate customers may scale their hardware as cloud workload rises.

AMD profits more by selling Genoa, which has bigger caches. This design gives systems more bursting capacity for each core. The economy is slowing but the demand for higher computing power is not making AMD one of the best chip S&P 500 stocks to buy.

Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), a global technology firm that designs semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions, posted strong third-quarter results.

It earned $4.424 billion and paid a stock dividend of $4.10 a share. It expects to pay out $16.40 a share in dividends for the fiscal year making it one of the hot S&P 500 stocks to buy.

Broadcom issued a strong revenue and adjusted EBITDA forecast for the fourth quarter. It is thriving amid strong demand across all end markets. Customers are upgrading their data centers and broadband. They are getting ready for higher network usage from the iPhone and Google Pixel smartphone refresh.

Broadcom’s positive prospects contradict the macro headwinds other sectors face. Customers are committed to technology projects.

In addition, Broadcom has 50 weeks in lead time in its backlog. Furthermore, Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan said that its products faced no disruptions from China’s Covid restrictions. CEO Tan predicts that semiconductor demand will continue in the 5% range for the long term.

Alphabet (GOOGL) A close-up shot of a Google Ads logo on a smartphone.

Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has several growth catalysts. YouTube will add advertising to Shorts videos and share revenue with content creators.

It needs to reward its creator entrepreneurs or risk losing them to ByteDance’s TikTok. Before it took this initiative, creators had only the horizontal video format. They depended on ads as the main source of revenue.

Within Shorts, which is as short as 15 seconds, YouTube content creators have a chance to make more money. This would increase the site’s ad revenue.

Google has high near-term costs to address. It added too many workers before the Federal Reserve started raising interest rates. Shortly thereafter, the economy slowed. The search engine giant is bracing for customers to slash advertising spending.

Further cost cuts will improve Alphabet’s profit margins. On September 14, 202, the company cut half of its internal research and development spending in “Area 120.” The cuts are necessary. The company needs to focus on growing markets first. This includes artificial intelligence projects.

Intel (INTC) The Intel logo in blue on a black screen.

Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is struggling to grow its personal computer chip market. Investors may bet that INTC stock’s low ~6 times price-to-earnings priced-in its hard times ahead. In addition, the company declared its quarterly dividend recently. Income investors get a dividend that yields moret han 5% just for waiting.

In the CPU market, Intel’s 13th-generation Raptor Lake will offer consumers more power.

Intel spent two years hyping its graphics card, called Intel Arc Alchemist. It enters the GPU product at a turbulent transition. Ethereum decommissioned crypto mining. By adopting proof-of-stake, miners with expensive GPUs cannot profit.

If it ever releases a GPU in mass volumes, Intel becomes the third supplier after AMD and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).

Intel only needs to grow its market share in the mainstream segment. It does not need to offer high-end performance products that Nvidia and AMD sell. It simply cannot afford more delays trying to capture that level of the market.

Once Intel gains the consumer’s trust in the graphics card market, its revenue will expand again.

Meta Platforms (META) Meta Written On The Googles - Man Wearing Virtual Reality Goggles Inside A Metaverse. FTC investigating META.

Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is taking a huge bet on the metaverse. It is spending billions annually over the next decade to invest in the augmented and virtual world.

On Oct.11 it might give its audience hints on its AR/VR headset offering. The headset is code-named Project Cambria.

The product is the successor to Meta Quest 2. The media speculates this headset is a high-end machine. It will have a higher price tag, which should lower Meta’s loss per unit sold. In addition, it will have advanced sensors. Meta hopes to convince potential buyers that the exclusive mixed-reality offering justifies the higher price.

Meta Quest 3 is still under development. At a higher price, the company likely needs more time to develop the hardware. Investors may assume it releases this high-end product with no bugs or fanfare. As a result, it pivots Meta Platforms away from Facebook and into the metaverse.

Nvidia announced the RTX 40 Series, which introduced Ada Lovelace architecture.

The company promises to deliver AI-powered graphics. Gamers will experience lifelike virtual worlds. They will enjoy higher frames per second (FPS) gaming. In addition, ray tracing increases the graphics quality in games.

Nvidia priced the RTX 4090 for $1,599. It will be available on October 12, 2022. The RTX 4080 16GB and 12GB will cost $1,199 and $899, respectively.

Nvidia’s centralized omniverse platform scales easily. Currently, omniverse is running on Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services EC2 G5 instances. As it adds more customers to it, the company will give early access to them if they apply.

Investors are not buying Nvidia stock despite the product announcements and cloud development news. They are worried that gamers are sensitive to the four-figure price tag.

Furthermore, GPU demand during the pandemic benefited from cryptocurrency mining. Although those miners are selling GPUs on auction sites, it should not hurt Nvidia’s sales. Gamers are unlikely to buy those used cards.

Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) is a military defense contractor. While the rest of the economy struggles, the War Economy is thriving.

The company won a ~ $770 million modification contract. Raytheon’s work in the award is with the propulsion system spare parts and the related handling of the F-135 propulsion system.

On Sept. 22 the company won a $985 million contract. It will supply the U.S. Department of Defense with Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missiles. On Sept. 21 Raytheon won a $160.2 million contract for a Dual Band Radar. The contract includes options that increase the total value to $440.64 million.

The contracts mentioned add up. While companies outside of the military defense sector struggle to grow contract deals, Raytheon is adding new ones regularly.

RTX stock is trading below its $90 – $95 trading range. The stock pays a dividend of $2.20 per share. Investors get paid to wait while the firm wins more contracts from the U.S. government.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the fund, its history and recent performance if you are short on time and go directly to 3 Best Stocks to Buy According to JANA Partners.

Founded in 2001, JANA Partners is a hedge fund that manages approximately $2 billion in assets. The firm is based in New York City and is run by founder, managing partner, and co-portfolio manager Barry Rosenstein. JANA Partners focuses on investing in companies that are undergoing change or are in need of operational improvement. The firm is known for being an activist investor, meaning that it takes an active role in the management of the companies in which it invests.

Prior to founding JANA Partners, Mr. Rosenstein worked as an investment banker at multiple financial institutions. He received his MBA, with honors, from the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business in 1984 and joined Merill Lynch’s mergers and acquisitions divisions in the same year. During the mid-80s, Mr. Rosenstein worked for well-known ‘corporate raider’ Asher B. Edelman’s Plaza Securities Corporation. Before founding JANA Partners with $35 million in capital, his last role was as a principal at Sagaponack Partners, a private equity firm.

JANA Partners’ investment philosophy has seen a radical shift over the years. What started as a value-oriented, event-driven fund has shifted its gears in the past few years and has turned into a full-blown activist hedge fund that also runs special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs). During the last decade, JANA closed down two of its stock-picking funds - Jana Partners and Jana Nirvana funds – and has concentrated on running its flagship Jana Strategic Investment (JSI) fund. Unlike most successful hedge funds, whose returns mostly come from stock-picking, market timing or quant strategies, JANA’s returns over the past few years can primarily be attributed to the work it did in restructuring its target companies.

The Jana Strategic Investment (JSI) fund has posted spectacular returns in recent years. While it made its investors richer by 30% after fees last year, it was up 52% in 2019 and has returned an average of 30% annually after fees over the previous three years. Not only that, but since its inception, Jana Strategic Investment (JSI) has posted a spectacular average annual return of 18%, comfortably beating the performance of the S&P500 during that time. 7 Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Barry Rosenstein’s JANA Partners

JANA Partners’ Portfolio

According to JANA Partners’ recently submitted regulatory filing, the aggregate value of its 13F holdings at the end of June was $1.15 billion, a substantial drop from over $1.5 billion at the end of March. In addition, during the second quarter, the fund reduced its holding in one stock, made additional purchases in four stocks and sold its entire stake in one company. Apart from individual stocks, JANA Partners also had substantial holdings in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), which accounted for almost 14% of its 13F portfolio value at the end of Q2. Though the fund sold its top holding from Q1, Zendesk, Inc. (NYSE:ZEN), other companies it has invested in like Mercury Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRCY), TreeHouse Foods, Inc. (NYSE:THS), and Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings (NYSE:LH) continued to remain among its top stocks picks at the end of Q2.

JANA Partners wrote a letter to Encompass Health Corporation’s (NYSE:EHC) management in November last year, urging them to pursue a possible merger with interested third parties for its home health and hospice business instead of spinning it off as an independent publicly traded company. However, the management didn’t heed that advice and went ahead with its plans.

231,2022-09-19T18:45:00+00:00,Another Monster Rate Hike Is on the Way,"The Federal Reserve is ready to pull the trigger on another 75 basis point rate hike this week.

On Wednesday, the U.S. central bank’s Federal Open Market Committee will meet before announcing its latest monetary policy decision. The FOMC will likely raise rates by three-quarters of a percent for a third straight meeting, according to economists and market-based estimates.

That would push the federal funds rate up to a range of 3% to 3.25%, the highest since 2008.

There were hopes that the Fed would slow the pace of hikes, perhaps by lifting rates “only” 50 basis points. Those hopes were dashed following the release last week of hotter-than-expected inflation data for August.

That consumer price index report, which showed an acceleration in core consumer prices (prices outside of food and energy), raised worries that inflation is rooting deeply in the economy, and the Fed would lift rates higher than previously thought.

Rate Hike Expectations Jump

Probabilities based on fed funds futures suggest an 18% chance the U.S. central bank will surprise markets with a full percentage point hike this week.

Markets expect the federal funds rate to reach a range of 4.25% to 4.5% by December before peaking at 4.5% to 4.75% in March.

Those expectations imply the fed lifting rates another 75 basis points in November before finally slowing in the coming months.

A fed funds rate above 4% isn’t something markets were pricing in as recently as last week. Before the latest CPI reading, the narrative was that inflation was still high but that it had “peaked” and would slowly come down. 
 
 That narrative hasn’t necessarily been discarded, but it’s on shaky ground after prices for key categories like medical care and shelter zoomed higher last month.

Powell Press Conference

In addition to seeing whether the Fed follows through with another 75 basis point rate hike (or something bigger), investors will be keyed in on Fed Chair Powell’s post-decision press conference at 2:30 ET on Sept. 21. They’ll be listening for clues on whether the markets are on the right track by pricing in a terminal rate (the highest federal funds rate of the cycle) of around 4.5% or if there’s the potential for even higher interest rates.

Story continues

Powell is well-aware of the lag between interest rate hikes and their impact on the economy. That’s why some people have cautioned Powell and the Fed to be careful not to move rates too high before the effects on the economy are clear.

Too much could push the economy into a recession; doing too little may ingrain inflation in the economy, forcing more drastic action in the future.

Market Reaction

For their part, markets haven’t liked the idea that rates are likely headed to 4% or more, but they’ve digested them relatively well so far. The two-year Treasury bond yield surged to 3.97% on Monday, the loftiest point since 2007.

But yields on longer-term Treasuries, like the 10-year and 30-year, have been more contained. With both around 3.5%, they are just above the highs they reached in June.

Similarly, prices for the iShares 7-10 Year Treasury Bond ETF (IEF) and the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) are hanging around the lows they were at in June (bond prices and yields move inversely).

Meanwhile, stocks plunged on the day of the August CPI report, as traders realized higher rates were coming. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) lost 4.4% and 5.5%, respectively.

But on the plus side, prices for both ETFs, which track the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq-100, respectively, are holding above their June lows. This week’s Fed decision and Powell’s press conference will play a role in determining whether or not those lows continue to hold.

JULIE HYMAN: Welcome back to Yahoo Finance Live. We are seeing markets under some pressure here this morning. Jared Blikre has an early check for us. Among other things markets are watching, Jay Powell.

JARED BLIKRE: Yes, as if he hasn't been speaking enough on the issue recently. Guess what? He's going to hike until something breaks, guys. That has been the message. I don't see that changing. Let's take a look at what's happening today. We can see markets under a little bit of pressure. NASDAQ off about 1%.

And let's go to a three-day view. We are in the third day of this holiday shortened week. And the NASDAQ is up about 1/3 of a percent. And let's go to the Dow as well. That is lagging today. That is up about 12 basis points, not much to write home about for the week, the nascent week here.

Here is the sector heat map. Everything in the red, although you can see energy just flipping into the green right now. We're going to get to crude oil in a second. Communication services, materials, consumer discretionary, and tech, those are rounding out the bottom, all down about 1% or more.

And if you take a look inside the NASDAQ, we're going to see kind of the flip from yesterday, although I don't think we've clawed back all of those gains that we had yesterday. This is a two-day look, so we can see Amazon holding onto gains of over 1%. So is Microsoft and Alphabet. Tesla holding onto gains of over 2%.

And let's take a look at some of our leaders. This is a two-day. We're going to go to a one-day. We can see IPOs getting a little love today, meme stocks, biotech. Not really seeing this as the most bullish action, but to the downside, we've got Chinese stocks, KWEB kind of trading on its own. That's down 2 and 1/2%, followed by a gambling ETF. That's BETS. XRT is retail.

Korean stocks, and this is reminding me, we've got to touch on currencies in a second. But before we do that, I did promise we'd get into some crude oil action. And as you noted, Julie, having turned around here. This is cotton. It looks like the numbers are changing here. Let's see if we can dial that in. OK, so WTI is up 1.7%. Now you're going to notice that we are hanging out in the lower 80s. The current price is 83.35. We hit about 81 and change earlier.

Story continues

And if I put a year to date view, you're going to see we haven't seen these prices all the way going back since to January. And just reading the literature and talking to some traders here, this market is very illiquid right now. The open interest on these futures contracts has been decreasing. So, in other words, the price action can be very erratic and not necessarily reflect the fundamentals.

I saw another report today. Interestingly, the SPR, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, has been drawn down to about 450 million barrels. But guess what? Our exports in the US could be-- our net exports could be twice that. So energy independence working for America right now. I think Americans will take the lower oil prices that come with lower gas prices. But again, very illiquid, erratic market right now. So we could see that shoot right back up, guys.

BRIAN SOZZI: Best believe it. Give me that $50 a barrel oil. Jared, hit us with some currency analysis.

JARED BLIKRE: Yes, all right, let's get to our currencies. And as we've been talking about here, the US dollar has been on an absolute tear. And we have that and because the Fed is raising rates at a higher amount and is expected to than other currencies around the world, other central banks around the world. So the US enjoying that dollar flow to take advantage of our higher rates.

Now, this is what's happening today. I want to show what's happened with respect to the US dollar over the last month. You can see the US dollar is up 6.6% versus the yen. And the yen has just been losing ground. So higher means stronger US dollar, weaker yen. And this is up 25% year to date. That is a record going back to the inception of cable trading against the pound in the modern forex era.

And then we've got to talk about cable as well. That would be the British pound. We'll see if I can dial that up. Here we go, US dollar versus a British pound. Now this is inverse to how it typically looks in a forex screen. We did this to show versus the US dollar. You can see that is up 17.6%. We wish our best for the queen and everybody else in Great Britain, but that's what we're seeing right now, guys.

RACHELLE AKUFFO: We're just less than two minutes away from the closing bell on this volatile day. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre to break down the market action. Hey, Jared.

JARED BLIKRE: Hey there. Well, it's been a day in the red. We can see the Dow down by 4/10 of a percent. NASDAQ down double that, almost 1%. The small cap Russell 2000 not far behind.

And let's take a look at what's happening inside the market. We're gonna look at the sector action for today. Energy been leading leading, as we had crude oil settling at $97.01. Haven't seen that kind of price in several weeks.

But we see the megacaps under a bit of pressure, as the yield curve shifts up, putting pressure on tech stocks. See Apple down 1%. Amazon down about 2/3 of a percent. Tesla, Meta down 1%. And Nvidia down nearly 3%.

And just checking in on that sector action, as I said, energy in the lead. Utilities also in the green. But everything else in the red. Tech getting the hardest hit here, followed by real estate, communication services, and then financials.

And we take a look at our leaders index. Only cannabis stocks in the green among this group. Chip stocks getting hit for about 2%. China stocks also weak. And so are the R components.

I do want to end with the travel components here. A little bit of a mixed board but also seeing some pressure on the United. That's down 1 and 1/2%. and Carnival down 1% as well.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/stocks-move-downside-close-yield-201815161.html,"['FVX.INDX', 'GSPC.INDX', 'IXIC.INDX', 'QQQ.US', 'SPY.US', 'TNX.INDX', 'TYX.INDX']",[],"{'polarity': 0.296, 'neg': 0.036, 'neu': 0.916, 'pos': 0.048}"
242,2022-08-29T19:13:46+00:00,10 Best Index Funds Popular Among Reddit Investors,"In this article, we discuss the 10 best index funds popular among Reddit investors. If you want to read about more index funds gaining attention on Reddit, go to the 5 Best Index Funds Popular Among Reddit Investors.

The popularity of index funds remains high among investors as they provide ownership of a broad range of equities like (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), and reduce the level of risk due to diversification. Retirement accounts like individual retirement accounts and 401(k) accounts are heavily invested in index funds.

Warren Buffett, legendary investor, philanthropist, and CEO of diversified conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE:BRK-B), suggests index funds as a refuge for savings for the later stages of life. Instead of singling out stocks for investments, the Oracle of Omaha recommends picking out all the stocks from the S&P 500 Index at an economical cost through an index fund. In an interview in 2017 with CNBC’s On The Money, Warren Buffett advised investors to “consistently buy an S&P 500 low-cost index fund.”

Index funds often perform better than their actively managed alternatives, in large part due to fees. According to Morningstar, an index fund’s average asset-weighted fee in 2020 was 0.12% compared to the active funds charging 0.62%. To match the return of an average index fund, the average active fund must generate an additional 0.5% in returns. The Head of Product Development and Strategy at ICICI Prudential AMC, Chintan Haria, shared that while directly investing in stocks may seem alluring, the level of research that is necessary to pick stocks can be time-consuming. Hence, index fund investing can be seen as a staging post to entering the realm of stock investing.

Since reaching their lows of June 14, index funds have staged a recovery, as the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQGM:QQQ), SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY), and SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:DIA) have regained 17.2%, 12.6%, and 10.3%, respectively. The Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQGM:QQQ) tracks the performance of the NASDAQ Composite Index. The Trust even entered the bull market during this period, as it surpassed gains of 20%. It must be noted that the average stock in the NASDAQ Composite Index has clawed back over 30% from its lows. It is a significant development, as there was a time when the majority of the stocks were down 50% from their peak.

Improvement related to economic conditions could be a major reason for the change in sentiment. Inflation for July 2022 showed a year-over-year increase of 8.5% as opposed to the consensus forecast of 8.7%. The lower-than-expected number for inflation boosted consumer sentiment, as the University of Michigan’s preliminary consumer sentiment index reading for August 2022 was posted at 55.1. This was higher than the median estimate of 52.5, according to data polled from Reuters. The consumer sentiment index reached a record low of 50 in June 2022. 10 Best Index Funds Popular Among Reddit Investors

Let’s begin our list of the 10 best index funds popular among Reddit investors. Notable Reddit forums were scoured to see which index funds are attracting investors. We also looked at r/wallstreetbets, r/stocks, r/personalfinance, and other forums for stocks and ETFs trading analysis. Furthermore, we have discussed some of the popular stocks being held by these funds and their top 10 holdings. These index funds have been ranked in terms of their net assets as of August 24.

10 Best Index Funds Popular Among Reddit Investors

10. Fidelity ZERO Large Cap Index Fund (NASDAQ:FNILX)

Net Assets: $5.61 billion

The Fidelity ZERO Large Cap Index Fund (NASDAQ:FNILX) is a fund replicating the performance of large-cap stocks listed on the U.S. equity market through its 515 holdings. The ETF came into being in 2018.

The top 10 holdings of the fund represent 26.32% of the portfolio value. Some of the popular stocks included in the portfolio are Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). The Fidelity ZERO Large Cap Index Fund’s (NASDAQ:FNILX) average 3-year return stands at over 13.14% as of August 24.

The Fidelity ZERO Large Cap Index Fund (NASDAQ:FNILX) is popular among Reddit users as it does not charge any fees to its investors. This is done so that consumers will be attracted to other financial products offered by Fidelity. Although the fund tracks the performance of the S&P 500 Index, it has not included the term “S&P” in its name because Standard and Poor’s charges a licensing fee of 0.03% of funds under management along with a fixed charge of $600,000. By not keeping S&P in its name, the fund can bypass the 0.03% expense ratio. However, the fund still tracks the S&P 500 Index very closely.

9. ARK Innovation ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKK)

Net Assets: $9.34 billion

The ARK Innovation ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKK) is an exchange-traded fund that has at least 65% of its investments in the field of disruptive innovation.

The ETF falls under the helm of Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management and defines disruptive innovation as a new product or service that is introduced due to advancement in technology and which modifies the way the world works. The ARK Innovation ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKK) has an annual management fee of 0.75% and is targeting industries focusing on automation, artificial intelligence, financial technology, and DNA technologies.

Retail investors are confident in the stock-picking ability of veteran investor and CEO of ARK Invest Cathie Wood. During a five-working-day period that ended on August 15, investors bought $54.2 million worth of ARK Innovation ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKK), according to VandaTrack. This was the fastest accumulation of the ETF during a five-working-day period since May 2022. Interestingly, the ARK Innovation ETF outperformed the shares of diversified conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE:BRK-B) during July, as it gained 9.5% as compared to the Omaha, Nebraska-based company’s rise of 8.3%.

8. SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:SPYG)

Net Assets: $14.38 billion

The SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:SPYG) is an ETF focusing on companies in the widely popular S&P 500 Index that offer the most stellar growth prospects. The SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:SPYG) has around 240 stocks in its portfolio and has a heavy focus on the information technology sector, followed by consumer discretionary, healthcare, communication services, and seven other sectors. The ETF is popular among Reddit investors as it offers a significantly low annual expense ratio of 0.04% and has a healthy daily average trading volume of over 2.75 million shares.

According to the latest data available, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) take up over 38% of the ETF’s holdings as of August 19. Meanwhile, the ETF's top 10 holdings represent more than 49% of the portfolio's value. Although the ETF has underperformed the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY) since the start of the year and in the last full year, it has outperformed the broader market over the past three and five years, respectively.

7. SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:DIA)

Net Assets: $28.46 billion

The SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:DIA) looks to replicate the performance of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), which comprises 30 blue-chip U.S.-based stocks.

The index has a long history of over a century and is one of the three leading market indices in the U.S. The SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:DIA) has an annual expense ratio of 0.16% as of August 24. The DJIA is a price-weighted index in which UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) take up 29.42% of the fund’s holdings. Meanwhile, the top 10 holdings represent 55% of the ETF’s portfolio.

Redditors believe that the 30 blue-chip stocks in the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:DIA) have strong fundamentals and can weather extreme economic uncertainty compared to average companies. Many of those 30 companies have a defensive business model and are known for making consistent dividend payouts to investors. The SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:DIA) offers a very different profile from the S&P 500 Index in terms of sector holdings.

6. Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHD)

Net Assets: $36.75 billion

The Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHD) is an ETF that tracks the performance of the Dow Jones US Dividend 100 Index and offers a yield of nearly 3.2% as of August 24. The Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHD), founded in 2011, has a track record of outperforming during both bear and bull markets. Furthermore, the fund has even held its ground during recessions. However, the fund’s short history does not include any period reflecting the current circumstances of multi-decade-high inflation.

Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO), The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) are the four biggest holdings in the ETF. These companies represent a combined stake of 17.3%, while the top 10 holdings take up 40.96% of the fund’s portfolio.

The fund appears to be popular among Reddit investors as it includes stocks that have been paying out dividends for the past ten consecutive years, have a market capitalization of at least $500 million, and fulfill certain requirements related to fundamentals and liquidity. Furthermore, the ETF does not include any master limited partnerships or and real estate investment trusts.

BRAD SMITH: Welcome back to ""Yahoo Finance Live"" this morning, everyone. We're seeing markets mixed as of right now, as the NASDAQ has trickled its way into positive territory, just barely to the upside. For more, let's get to Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre live at the Interactive right now. Jared, excuse me there.

BRIAN SOZZI: Oh, no, that's fine. We got a whole lot of nothing going on in the markets. Down 6 basis points, up 4, up 19. Doesn't really that matter that much. So we're going to take a longer term view of the S&P 500. This is a one-year chart with candlesticks, and just want to point out what has been happening. This is a downtrend. This is a long-term downtrend. And hopefully, you can see this, but we've had a number of false breakouts.

This first happened in December. Then we had a false breakout in about March, just before that April meltdown here. And again, we just saw that this could be a potential false breakdown, false break to the upside, because we sank back below 4,200 pretty quickly. Now, this big move right here, this was concurrent-- and I want to show you the US dollar index. That was concurrent with the US dollar index falling versus a broad basket of currencies. This took 20 days right here, and it only took seven days to reach that to the upside.

And I'm fond of this max chart of the US dollar index. This goes back all the way to the 1980s. And guess what? We are in territory. We have now surpassed the mid-2000 highs, and we are back on track to potentially get to 120. This would have huge implications for the Fed and everything else that we're tracking. Now, I mention this because we have Jay Powell giving a critical speech this Friday morning. And I'm thinking, all right, if he's going to goose the stocks, how is that going to happen?

I think the only thing that can happen is he talks about the US dollar, and specifically quantitative tightening. He is very data-dependent, as is the rest of the Fed right now. And if it comes to the US dollar sinking because of his comments, that's about the only thing I can see, to the upside, that's going to come out of these comments. So to recap briefly, let's just go over some of the sectors here. We got energy in the forefront once again, crude oil up, but then real estate, industrials, consumer discretionary, materials. So kind of a mix here. Again, not much happening today, but we are waiting for those fireworks Friday morning.

Video Transcript

[MUSIC PLAYING]

BRAD SMITH: Welcome back to ""Yahoo Finance Live"" on a big day for the retail sector. Let's get down to Jared Blikre on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. We're seeing some declines early in today's tape, Jared. What are you hearing? What are you seeing down there on the floor?

JARED BLIKRE: That's right. Worth remembering that we had VIX futures expiration this morning. We also have options expiration, the monthly one, this Friday, and that has some significance here. I'm looking at the YFi Interactive. Haven't seen a bad start to a day like this in some time. But notice the NASDAQ isn't even down about 1% right now. Russell 2000 is down a little bit more than that, more than 1%.

I want to focus on the year-to-date chart that we have of the S&P 500. Now, yesterday, we just kissed the 200-day moving average. I haven't drawn it in perfectly, but it looks something like that. Important to note that it's still on the downslope. So until we get through that hurdle-- and it's a big psychological hurdle-- and use it as support, probably not going to bounce back towards those highs. In fact, the market has come so fast, so quickly-- so far, so quickly, that's about 20% in the S&P 500, 25% in the NASDAQ, could be due for a pullback. And all of this comes with options expiration in August.

And also, I should note, this is a very illiquid month known for its volatility spikes. And having said that, I just want to go to the VIX here. Let's see if we can pull up a VIX, hovering around 20. But we had been looking at a 35 handle only a few months ago. And we are right back down to potential support. So it would be natural for the market to turn at these levels. We'll have to see what comes of that, if anything.

BRAD SMITH: Jared, while we have you, there has been some downward pressure on crude oil prices. How are we looking today? And how are the majors holding up there?

Story continues

JARED BLIKRE: Well, crude was the one bright spot. If we take a look at the YFi Interactive, we don't see that much positive price action anymore. A lot of these names had been in the green. But hey, Pioneer Natural Resources, they rang the opening bell here. And let me just show you, this is a typical chart for one of these oil companies. You can call them the wildcats. They were kind of wild on the open here.

But since 2015, a lot of these-- a lot of these smaller companies, even the majors, have been battered and bruised by volatile oil prices. Starting in 2015, went from $100 down to $30. Went all the way to negative $40 over the pandemic. That was something that blew my mind. But now we're trying to find some stabilization here.

Crude oil WTI has a handle of about 85 right now. And you think that's a pretty wide range when we go all the way up to 120, 130, those previous highs. Searching for a potential bottom right now. We had some comments from the Kuwaiti leader of OPEC+ right now. He's saying that we need to basically invest, invest, invest, and that's what I think needs to happen. Because if you like those Lululemon pants, guess what? Dead dinosaurs in them, not just going in your internal combustion fuel tank, guys.

BRIAN SOZZI: Thanks for reminding me there, Jared. My Lululemon pants made from dead dinosaurs. Jared Blikre, thank you so much.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/stocks-open-lower-retail-sales-140136530.html,"['BZ.COMM', 'CL.COMM', 'DJI.INDX', 'GSPC.INDX', 'IXIC.INDX', 'QQQ.US', 'SPY.US']",[],"{'polarity': 0.947, 'neg': 0.052, 'neu': 0.857, 'pos': 0.091}"

5 Most-Loved ETFs of Last Week

Last week, ETFs pulled in a whopping $26.6 billion in capital, pushing year-to-date inflows to $381.1 billion. U.S. equity ETFs led the way higher, accumulating $17.5 billion in inflows, closely followed by inflows of $8 billion for U.S. fixed-income ETFs and $1.6 billion for international fixed-income ETF, per etf.com.

The U.S. stock market logged its fourth winning week in a row, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index entering a new bull market. The slowdown in inflation last month brought much-needed relief to the stock market and perked up investor sentiment. The consumer price index jumped 8.5% year over year in July, down from a 9.1% year-over-year increase in June, which was the fastest increase since November 1981. This, coupled with recession fears, has spurred bets that the Fed could start lowering the pace of rate hikes (read: Nasdaq Enters Bull Market: ETFs to Tap the Rally).

Additionally, U.S. consumer sentiment improved in August from a record low earlier this summer. The University of Michigan's preliminary sentiment index rose to a three-month high of 55.1 from 51.5 in July.

257,2022-08-11T18:45:00+00:00,Gold ETFs’ Performance This Year Defies Inflation Hedge Thesis,"One of the most widely touted inflation hedges isn’t acting quite the way that investors had hoped.

Gold ETFs like the SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) and the iShares Gold Trust (IAU) are down 2.3% even as inflation runs at its highest level in close to four decades.

Spot Gold

That’s a disappointing outcome for investors, who have added $4.3 billion to the top 10 gold ETFs since the start of the year.

Ticker Fund YTD Inflows GLD SPDR Gold Trust $1,922.15M GLDM SPDR Gold MiniShares Trust $997.57M IAU iShares Gold Trust $742.20M IAUM iShares Gold Trust Micro $218.56M SGOL Aberdeen Standard Physical Gold Shares ETF $136.71M AAAU Goldman Sachs Physical Gold ETF $70.47M OUNZ VanEck Merk Gold Trust $63.48M GDXU MicroSectors Gold Miners 3X Leveraged ETN $60.52M FGLD Franklin Responsibly Sourced Gold ETF $26.41M RING iShares MSCI Global Gold Miners ETF $22.79M

Gold has been sold as a commodity that preserves its value against inflation, yet if it can’t rise in an extraordinary year for inflation like 2022, it calls into question that entire thesis.

On an inflation-adjusted basis, gold prices reached their recent peak in mid-2020. Since then, they’ve lost a quarter of their value. The record inflation-adjusted high for gold prices was reached in 1980, when inflation was raging at double-digit levels.

Inflation-Adjusted Gold Price

Still Outperforming

Gold bulls might argue that this year’s modest decline in gold prices is actually a good showing for the precious metal in the context of the large declines seen in financial markets. At their worst point, the S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and the iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF (AGG) were down by 22.5% and 12.5%, respectively.

YTD Returns

Compared to that, gold has solidly outperformed, and bulls could argue that makes the metal a good portfolio diversifier. Still, unlike stocks and bonds, gold offers investors no yield, and its value primarily comes from its aesthetic properties and the collective belief that it’s something that’s valuable.

Story continues

That collective belief is obviously still there, though it’s weakened in recent years as bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies entered the scene and stole some of gold’s appeal as a store of value.

Gold Up in Foreign Currencies

Another defense of metal centers around the idea that the gold market is global.

While prices for gold are down a little more than 2% in U.S. dollars, gold prices are up when translated into most other currencies.

In euros and pounds, gold is up around 8%; in yen, it’s up 13%. So anyone holding gold or gold ETFs outside of the U.S. is probably pretty content with their performance.

Gold has shown this year that it’s too volatile to be an inflation hedge. While you could make the case that it’s maintained much of its value over very long periods of time—multiple decades or even centuries, it doesn’t necessarily do so over the time periods investors care about: months, years or even a few decades.

A more reliable inflation hedge would be the Treasury inflation-protected securities you find in ETFs like the Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities ETF (VTIP), which compensate investors directly based on the consumer price index.

And for multiyear periods, you might as well invest in assets that can not only hold their value against inflation but grow their value against inflation—like stocks.

258,2022-08-09T17:00:05+00:00,Follow Oppenheimer? Buy S&amp;P 500 ETFs,"The S&P 500 is off 13.5% this year (as of Aug 3, 2022). Heightened rising rate worries amid super-hawkish Fed cues, red-hot inflation, supply chain woes and the Russia-Ukraine war have dampened Wall Street this year. The index saw the worst start to a year since 1939.

But things are turning for the better. The index is up 7.6% past month. Those who are worried about the S&P 500 market crash in early phase of this year may find this piece of information useful as investment banking firm Oppenheimer said that the S&P 500 could gain by another 12% by year-end, as quoted on a TIPRanks article, published on Yahoo Finance.

Oppenheimer’s Head of Technical Analysis Ari Wald believes that the latest gains in the S&P 500 to continue ahead. Wald explained, “we see upside into 4,300 and are open to a higher low above 3,920 in the seasonally weak September period. Overall, we maintain our view that the index is on the road to recovery and think 4,600 (~12% upside) is reasonable by year-end.”

Better-than-feared Q2 earnings from some of the world's biggest companies and easing pace of the future Fed rate hikes should bolster the index ahead. Investors have re-priced stocks too quickly this year to bake in sky-high inflation and the Federal Reserve’s faster interest rate hikes.

According to Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, global interest rates will likely keep rising until 2023 and that’s when continued rate hikes will cool inflation and help stabilize economies and markets, as quoted on CNBC.

Per Zacks Earnings Trends issued on Jul 27 2022, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to increase +4.2% from the same period last year on +10.4% higher revenues. Expected earnings growth for 2022 and 2023 are 8.2% and 7.9%, respectively on 9.7% and 4.4% revenue growth, per the report.

The Earnings Report also highlighted that margin reached the cyclical high point in 2018 as a result of the tax cut legislation, but modestly shrank the following year 2019 and contracted massively due to the pandemic in 2020. Margins rebounded impressively in 2021 and are on track to reach new all-time records in 2022 and expand further in 2023.

ETFs to Watch

If you follow Oppenheimer, you can easily bet on the recent rally in the S&P 500. Against this backdrop, investors may track S&P 500 ETFs like Vanguard S&P 500 ETF VOO, iShares Core S&P 500 ETF IVV and SPDR S&P 500 ETF SPY.

Investors can also play the growth part of the index with SPYG and the value part of the index with SPYV. SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF Fund SPYD is a good bet for the dividend plays of the index. SPYD yields 3.84% annually.

270,2022-08-01T10:20:10+00:00,Should SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY) Be on Your Investing Radar?,"Looking for broad exposure to the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market? You should consider the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 01/29/1993.

The fund is sponsored by State Street Global Advisors. It has amassed assets over $377.02 billion, making it the largest ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.

Why Large Cap Blend

Companies that fall in the large cap category tend to have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Considered a more stable option, large cap companies boast more predictable cash flows and are less volatile than their mid and small cap counterparts.

Blend ETFs are aptly named, since they tend to hold a mix of growth and value stocks, as well as show characteristics of both kinds of equities.

Costs

When considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts in the long term if all other factors remain equal.

Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.09%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.

It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.46%.

Sector Exposure and Top Holdings

While ETFs offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, a deep look into a fund's holdings is a valuable exercise. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.

This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 27.90% of the portfolio. Healthcare and Financials round out the top three.

Looking at individual holdings, Apple Inc. (AAPL) accounts for about 6.63% of total assets, followed by Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN).

The top 10 holdings account for about 27.34% of total assets under management.

Performance and Risk

SPY seeks to match the performance of the S&P 500 Index before fees and expenses. The S&P 500 Index is composed of five hundred selected stocks, all of which are listed on national stock exchanges and span over 25 separate industry groups.

Story continues

The ETF has lost about -13.14% so far this year and is down about -5.14% in the last one year (as of 08/01/2022). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $365.86 and $477.71.

The ETF has a beta of 1 and standard deviation of 23.81% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 505 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.

Alternatives

SPDR S&P 500 ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, SPY is a reasonable option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Blend area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.

The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) and the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) track the same index. While Vanguard S&P 500 ETF has $260.09 billion in assets, iShares Core S&P 500 ETF has $306.38 billion. VOO has an expense ratio of 0.03% and IVV charges 0.03%.

Bottom-Line

An increasingly popular option among retail and institutional investors, passively managed ETFs offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; they are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.

274,2022-07-28T15:03:08+00:00,EXCLUSIVE: Why One Top Hedge Fund Manager Is Bullish On US Cannabis Stocks,"Investment expert and former hedge fund manager Whitney Tilson, current president and CEO of Empire Financial Research, recently stopped by Benzinga Cannabis Hour to discuss his investment thesis including his 2022 outlook as it pertains to the booming cannabis industry.

The Value Of Value Investing

Tilson described himself as an “old school value investor,” who “learned investing at the feet of the masters, like Buffet and Munger,"" adding that he is always trying to expand his mind and remain open to new investment opportunities.

“I just listed my number one stock pick for my newsletter business for this year...and it's AdvisorShares Pure US Cannabis ETF (ARCA: MSOS) -  basically the U.S. cannabis index,” Tilson said.

He added that he remains bullish on the cannabis industry because “the sentiment is changing” along with cannabis legislation.

Tilson qualified the advance of legalization in states as irreversible. “Just look at the surveys of Americans who favor legalizing cannabis. It's gone up dramatically, and politicians will follow the voters, eventually, for sure, and the regulators will follow the politicians, and the institutional investors will come along as well.”

Setting And Identifying Trends

“I like identifying trends early. As an investor, the single best thing you can do is find an enormous trend and get in early, before all the institutional money comes in,” Tilson told Cannabis Hour hosts Javier Hasse and Elliot Lane.

“In particular if you can get in when the sentiment is crappy and the valuations are low!” Tilson added.

In addition, he shared the story of how he got ""ahead of an enormous trend"" and called the top at Tilray (NASDAQ: TLRY).

""My history in this sector is fairly limited, but [the trend] it first came to my attention in the enormous bubble that had to blow of top in September 2018, when famously Tilray hit $300 a share, intraday, and at that time, you know...Tilray was trading 'north' of 1000x revenue and had a 30-plus billion market cap, it was absurd, and I went on national television on Yahoo Finance, literally, the hour Tilray peaked at $300 a share. I said 'this is one of the most extreme bubbles I have ever seen in my investing career', this stock could be down 50 percent in a matter of weeks, would be down 90 percent, turns out I was too conservative, it went down from $300 to $3, under $3, went down by more than 99%.""

Story continues

The Green Thumb Industries Bet

Tilson explained that after calling the top at Tilray's bubble he stopped paying attention to the sector, until last year. His team built a ""blue-wave basket"" of cannabis stocks they perceived could benefit from the triumph of Democrat candidate, Joe Biden, in the last presidential elections. ""Of a ten-stock portfolio we put together for our subscribers, one of them was Green Thumb Industries (CNSX:GTII) (OTC: GTBIF), at $13. It went to almost $40 within about six months, and we got our subscribers out at $29, made 112% for our subscribers in about nine months.""

Long-Term Investor

Responding to a question from Cannabis Hour's audience, ""Isn't it funny how the 'older' guys have a longer time horizon than 'younger' investors? YEARS, not days,"" Tilson noted that indeed, he was “not retiring ever” and advised younger investors that they “should have a long-term horizon.”

Tilson pointed out that younger investors have grown up in the longest bull market in history. ""You have been conditioned to buy every dip and that is not the way the stock market works. The meme stocks for example. Just because something goes from 10x revenues to 20x and then trades back to 10x revenue does not mean that stock is cheap!”

Tilson advised that investors should look at the trends as well as EBITDA and the fundamentals of cannabis companies before investing. He described EBITDA as representing “real cash flow...real revenue” that can become a “real catalyst” for investments.

Tilson explained how he learned about the two best ways to make money throughout his career and shared his thoughts on what he considers to be the best MSOs. He advised young investors to control their expenses, taking advantage of their retirement plans at work (which could be ""the ultimate investment of all times"") and investing in index funds such as S&P 500. ""I happen to tell my daughters 'look, just buy the S&P 500 index fund (NYSE: SPY)'; and for most people, 'just buy an index fund.'  Now, if you want to try to be a little clever and buy a couple of sector funds like MSOS or XBI, for cannabis or biotech, great.""

Bath & Body Works shares fell about 2% in Wednesday trading after the retailer slashed its second-quarter earnings estimate to $0.40-$0.42 a share. Previously, the company forecasted earnings of $0.60-$0.65 a share.

""As we progressed through the second quarter, we experienced declines in traffic trends compared to the first quarter of 2022,"" the company said in pre-recorded commentary accompanying the warning. ""Our customer continues to respond to our merchandise and our shopping experience in stores and online. However, our data indicates that customers, particularly lower-income customers, have become more cost conscious and are limiting purchases and/or seeking out lower-priced sale merchandise as they are being impacted by the overall inflationary environment.""

Analysts wasted no time serving up critical hot takes on the massive profit whiff from the scented lotion king.

A""More concerning to us was the implied second-half margin outlook, which we estimate are baking in 600-700 basis points more promotional pressure in second half versus the outlook two months ago,"" Evercore ISI nalyst Omar Saad said. ""Recall that we just downgraded Bath & Body Works last week on concerns that its sales are being pressured both by normalization and spending shift towards more experiential categories.""

The company's shares are down 57% year to date.

An ongoing trend

Bath & Body Works is just the latest example of increasing stress on the country's retailers as shoppers reign in their spending due to rampant inflation.

In early June, Target kicked off concerns about the retail sector's health with a shocking decision to liquidate massive amounts of slow-moving inventory and take a more cautious view on near-term profits.

Since then, discretionary retailers such as RH, Bed Bath & Beyond, and Kohl's have issued financial warnings for their second quarters. Nike took a more measured approach to its full-year financial outlook when it reported quarterly earnings.

Story continues Amy Perkins looks at candles in the Bath and Body Works store at White Marsh Mall in Maryland. (Barbara Haddock Taylor/Baltimore Sun/Tribune News Service via Getty Images)

Gap also fired its CEO last week after another lackluster quarter.

""I have never — maybe I don't remember — seen as much discounting with as much merchandise with high percents off,"" former Gap and J Crew CEO Mickey Drexler said on Yahoo Finance Live recently.

Amid the concerns about profits for retailers, the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund has tanked 26% so far in 2022 compared to an 17% decline for the S&P 500.

Growth in the global chip industry is expected to slow by more than half to 10% in 2022 from 25% in 2021, Deloitte said in its 2022 semiconductor outlook report. The slowdown was underscored by memory chipmaker Micron (NASDAQ:MU) in late June when it reported its fiscal year 2022 third-quarter results. Chief executive officer Sanjay Mehrotra said in the release, “Recently, the industry demand environment has weakened, and we are taking action to moderate our supply growth in fiscal 2023.”

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Outlook Positive For Semiconductor Stocks

The mid- and long-term outlook is positive. Chip shortages and supply chain issues that were front and center in the first half of 2022 will likely ease by the second half, per Deloitte, though the management consultancy firm does expect lead times for some components to stretch well into 2023.

More and more products — connected devices at homes and smart tags on every box in warehouses — integrate at least some chips in their design. Deloitte expects chip content per car to nearly double between 2013 and 2030.

Against this backdrop, these are a few semiconductor stocks that can be picked up as bargain buys on the dips:

Synaptics (NASDAQ:SYNA) $119.29 MaxLinear (NASDAQ:MXL) $34.55 SMART Global (NASDAQ:SGL) $17.11 Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) $153.72 Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) $47.11 AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) $78.60 Navitas (NASDAQ:NVTS) $3.79 Allegro MicroSystems (NASDAQ:ALGM) $20.64

San Jose, California-based Synaptics (NASDAQ:SYNA) is a developer of custom-designed chips, firmware, and software semiconductor solutions for end markets, including Internet of Things (IOT), PCs, and mobile. It supplies connectivity products, audio input and output system-on-chips (SoCs), high-definition video and vision SoCs, SoCs with AI capabilities, touch controllers, touchpads, display drivers and fingerprint biometric sensors.

Third-quarter results released in early May showed 44% year-over-year (Y-o-Y) revenue growth to $470.1 million and record non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) of $3.75. Synaptics said IOT product applications accounted for roughly two-thirds of its total revenue.

Synaptics flagged weakness in China and at a North American handset maker, along with softer PC sales. The company circumvented the adverse developments with its well-diversified products and customer base. Synaptics issued upbeat guidance for the fourth quarter.

Notwithstanding the stellar fundamental performance, the stock is down close to 60% YTD. The average analysts’ price target for the stock is $216.11, suggesting roughly 85% upside potential.

MaxLinear (NASDAQ:MXL) is a provider of radio-frequency (RF) analog, digital and mixed-signal semiconductor solutions meant for access and connectivity, wired and wireless infrastructure, and industrial and multi-market applications.

For the first quarter that ended in March 2022, the company reported a record revenue of $263.9 million. Y-o-Y, the topline grew 26%.

In early May, the company announced a deal to buy Silicon Motion (NASDAQ:SIMO), a manufacturer of NAND flash controllers for solid-state storage devices. The proposed deal will create a profitable company with over $2 billion in revenue. It also adds to MaxLinear’s total addressable market, increasing it from $8 billion currently to $15 billion by 2024.

The stock is down about 55% YTD. The average analysts’ price target of $57.50 suggests scope for over 70% upside potential.

SMART Global (NASDAQ:SGH), which was once focused 100% on memory solutions, has now diversified its products and geographies. The recent quarterly results released by the company showed that about 57% of revenue came from memory solutions, 22% from intelligent platform solutions and the remaining 21% from LED solutions.

In the third quarter that ended in May 2022, the company’s revenue grew for the ninth consecutive quarter. Non-GAAP EPS climbed 24% to $0.87.

Also in late June, SMART Global announced a deal to buy Stratus Technologies for up to $275 million. The latter is a provider of autonomous computing solutions in the data center and at the Edge. In March 2021, the company had bought CREE LED products business for up to $300 million.

The stock is down about 50% YTD. The average analysts’ price target for SMART Global is $31.60, up about 85% from current levels.

Nvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) logo on a laptop screen trading stock market

Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a must-have blue-chip chip stock that is trading at a very attractive valuation. As I have pointed out in my late March story reviewing the company’s GPU Technology Conference and subsequently in a May article, Nvidia has a diversified product portfolio and customer base. The company’s fundamentals have been fairly solid for years now.

Even amid the economic and market mayhem in the March quarter, Nvidia reported stellar quarterly results. The company, however, issued soft guidance, citing the China lockdowns and weaker gaming demand from Russia. The predicament alone cannot justify the nearly 50% drop in the company’s stock for the YTD.

The company has an enviable TAM opportunity of $1 trillion, with contributions from both hardware and software.

Recently, a slew of analysts lowered their price targets for Nvidia stock. Most Wall Street firms are concerned about inventory build-up that could negatively impact prices. Despite all the price target reductions, the average analysts’ price target for the stock is $257.41, up nearly 70% from current levels.

Santa Clara, California-based Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) manufactures semiconductors for data infrastructure and technology companies. The company reported in late-May record revenue for the first quarter of fiscal-year 2023, thanks to strong bookings in all of its data infrastructure end markets. Within the data center, Cloud served as a key source of strength.

Upside in carrier infrastructure and automotive end markets also helped. The company has a relatively smaller exposure to the consumer end market. Any slowdown in consumer sentiment and in turn spending amid the economic challenges may not hurt Marvell Technology disproportionately.

CEO Matt Murphy sounded upbeat on the earnings call.

As we look into the second half of this year and beyond, we are confident that our unique growth drivers in our cloud, 5G, auto and enterprise networking end markets, and our strong track record of execution through economic cycles will continue to be a source of strength.

Murphy also touted the company’s recent design wins as contributors to incremental revenue going forward.

The average analysts’ price target for Marvell Technology stock is $80.33, representing roughly 70% upside from current levels. The stock is down about 45% YTD.

AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) is another high-profile chipmaker that has seen a strong turnaround since early 2017. The fortunes of the company have been rising since the launch of the Ryzen lineup of desktop processors and EPYC server processors. AMD was previously competing only on price and did not focus on high-performance processors.

All these changed under the visionary leadership of CEO Lisa Su.  She shifted the company’s focus and product roadmap to align with evolving technologies. The company began developing high-performance computing products that posed competitive threat to its bigger rival Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).

AMD’s market share in the x86 processor rose to a record 27.7% in the first quarter of 2022, according to Mercury Research. The company is also making strong inroads into the server market. Intel, though still a leader, is seeing its market share continuously erode, primarily  due to AMD’s competitive push and its own product missteps.

After an extended rally that lasted from late-2017 through late-2021, AMD’s stock has retreated notably. This positions the company for a strong rebound when the macroeconomic conditions and industry fundamentals improve.

Dublin, Ireland-headquartered Navitas (NASDAQ:NVTS) manufactures gallium nitride (GaN) power integrated circuits (ICs). These chips integrate GaN power with drive, control, and protection, boasting fast charging, high power density, and energy savings.  GaN, according to the company, runs up to 20 times faster than legacy silicon, provides up to three times more power, and allows three times faster charging in half of the size and weight.

Founded in 2014, Navitas caters to end markets such as mobile, consumer, enterprise, eMobility and new-energy markets. Its clientele include the high-and-mighty in the tech world, including Lenovo (OTC:LNVGF), Dell (NYSE:DELL) and LG Electronics.

GaN IC’s TAM opportunity is about $13 billion by 2026, the company estimates. Demand for connectivity, the shift away from fossil fuels, and the accent on sustainable energy sources will likely serve as positive catalysts for growth.

The company came public via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) deal with blank check company Live Oak. The deal valued the combined company at about $1 billion, including private investment in public equity of around $145 million.

The added incentive is its extremely attractive valuation. The stock is down over 71% for the YTD. Analysts, on average, expect the stock to more than double from current levels.

Recently, Allegro MicroSystems acquired Heyday Integrated Circuits, a private-held company specializing in fully-integrated gate drivers that enable energy conversion in semiconductor designs.

301,2022-07-10T12:11:37+00:00,Retirement expert: This tax strategy is ‘one of the great silver linings’ of a down market,"Even though there is talk of a recession and the stock market has been in the red for most of 2022, some financial experts say the news isn't all bad for those who are planning for retirement.

Christine Benz, director of personal finance and retirement planning for Morningstar, offered some strategies investors can use to find upside in a volatile stock market.

Tax-loss harvesting is a strategy that offers ""one of the great silver linings in a down market,"" Benz told Yahoo Finance (video above).

""This strategy would apply to your taxable account — so not to your retirement account, not to your 401(k) or your IRA,"" Benz said. ""If you have taxable holdings in a brokerage account, the idea is that you can sell them. If they are trading below what you paid for them, sell them, realize a loss, and then you can use that loss to offset gains elsewhere in your portfolio."" ( Photo Credit: Getty Creative)

While tax-loss harvesting can help investors save money, Benz said investors should consult a financial adviser and be mindful of the ""wash rule"" when selling their securities.

""You can't rebuy that same security within 30 days of having sold it,"" she explained, ""otherwise you'll negate the tax loss. You can't sell the same security or what the IRS considers a substantially identical security.""

In other words, investors wouldn't be able to sell an S&P 500 index fund (^GSPC) and swap into an S&P 500 ETF (SPY), she added.

Benz also recommended investors convert their traditional IRA plans to Roth ones to save money on taxes since taxes on portfolio conversions aren't as high in a down market. She noted there are a couple of benefits of doing so.

""One is tax-free withdrawals in retirement, no required minimum distributions,"" Benz said. ""That's why people like the idea of getting money over into the Roth IRA column. The advantage of doing so when the market has dropped is that your balance has dropped. And the taxes due upon making these conversions would be less than when the market was higher.""

In addition to tax strategies, Benz pointed out that lower stock prices can help investors who are dollar-cost averaging the same amount of money at regular intervals into their retirement plans.

This constitutes another ""silver lining"" in a stock market downturn, she said.

""Both stock and bond prices are down, so if [you] dollar-cost average or if you're someone who just is moving money into your plan on an ongoing basis through your 401(k) plan, for example, keep doing that because lower prices are your friend when you're in accumulation mode,"" Benz continued.

Lastly, Benz advised investors who are starting to save for retirement not to pay too much attention to the daily ups and downs of their portfolios.

""For people who are in the accumulation phase, I always say a policy of benign neglect,"" Benz said. ""The less you're paying attention to your portfolio, the better. A good once-yearly or twice-yearly check-in on that portfolio is plenty for most people.""

Video Transcript

JARED BLIKRE: Yeah, and I'm looking at the futures, stock futures specifically on the YFi Interactive ticking down here. And let's pull up an intraday chart. You can see there is a nasty little bar there. However, in the context, we were just saying the markets really hadn't been moving that much. Looks like a big deal, really not that much given the current context of the market.

So let me just widen this out to a two-month view so we can see what's happening there. It's still just a blip on your screen. A lot of times there's a fake out move. There's a move to the downside. You get a little zig, a zag, and then things really don't get going until about 10:00 AM. So we'll have to see what comes of this.

Let me check some of the other markets here. Copper futures, those have been under pressure. It looks like copper is down about 1.9% today. This is a two-month chart, so you can see that, still in a very firm downtrend. Gold futures not doing a whole lot, but it looks like they're testing multi-month, maybe multi-year lows here. Let's take a look, yes, to the downside, a little bit of action there.

And WTI doesn't always move that much on these reports, and it looks like it's not moving that much as well. Also got to check out the 10-year T note futures, and these move inversely to yields. So it looks like yields are picking up here.

And then just a quick comment on the revisions bump. The prior month of April was revised up in terms of hourly wage growth to 0.4%. That, along with the headline, Pete, could be weighing on markets right here, but still got to keep some context. This is a relatively small move, given the size and volatility of the moves we've seen recently.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/stock-futures-edge-higher-markets-125125525.html,"['ES.COMM', 'FVX.INDX', 'GC.COMM', 'GSPC.INDX', 'IXIC.INDX', 'MNQ.COMM', 'NQ.COMM', 'QQQ.US', 'SPY.US', 'TNX.INDX', 'TYX.INDX', 'YM.COMM']",[],"{'polarity': 0.929, 'neg': 0.035, 'neu': 0.892, 'pos': 0.073}"

Video Transcript

- All right, getting back on the markets. They're still taking their cue on all things inflation and Federal Reserve. That raises the argument, folks, that for stocks to exit bear market land, inflation will have to cool down. Let's get into this more with Aadil Zaman, a partner at Wall Street Alliance Group. Aadil, good to see you here this morning. When do you think we'll see just inflation start to cool more broadly? And when will the market actually start to realize that is, in fact, actually happening?

- Great to be with you. So we think that this inflation is going to take time to come down. It's not going to be quick. If you look at the 30-year fixed mortgage rate, for example, is jumped up from 3% to north of 6%. But yet, housing prices year over year are still up. If you look at things like oil inflation, natural gas inflation, food inflation, those are things that the Federal Reserve has very little control over.

And globally, inflation is skyrocketing as well. You think we have it bad, look at Turkey. The inflation rate is around 79%. So for those reasons, we think that inflation is going to come down, we are headed in the right direction as shown by the PCE, but it is going to take time. And until then, the market is going to continue to be down.

- What is the reality of comments that we've already started to hear pour in from the likes of Jamie Dimon, from Elon Musk, from Mark Zuckerberg around what they're seeing in kind of the economic gloom, perhaps, that they're forecasting at this point in time?

- Yeah. So we think that the right now, Chairman Powell has made it clear that his priority is inflation, to control that, even if it lands us up in a recession. And we think that the next shoe to drop is going to be donward earnings revisions. And we are going to, as you mentioned, comments from Jamie Dimon and Elon Musk, we are going to start to hear more CEOs echo those comments. And we feel that could be the next shoe to drop in the market. And we have to remember that a bear market usually lasts for around 16 months. We've just entered this one. So most likely, we have longer to go over here.

Story continues

- Is there anything positive you're seeing in markets?

- The positive thing, Brian, about bear markets is that it always creates opportunities, buying opportunities. Some of the stocks that are on our watch list that we like right now on this decline are companies like Amazon, companies like Home Depot, companies like Visa. And if you see people are splurging on traveling right now, there's something called ""revenge traveling"" where people are traveling because they couldn't during the pandemic. And that helps a company like Visa that benefits tremendously from cross-border travel-related spending.

If you look at a company like Amazon, the stock is down more than 30% year to date. A case can be made that the Cloud division by itself is valued more than what is reflected in the stock price. And home equities have soared North of $27 trillion. This would help a company like Home Depot because people can use that equity to upgrade their homes.

- OK. And so at a time where consumers still are going to have to navigate higher prices for those who, perhaps, are priced out of buying a new home, there's all of the other considerations because the necessities that you're paying for are costing more. And so what is the real confidence that a consumer has in this environment and where does that also impact companies margins at the end of the day too?

- Great question. So we think that as far as the consumer is concerned, their balance sheets are still very strong. Consumers are sitting on north of $2 trillion in savings. If you look at home equities, they've soared to a record north of $27 trillion. If you look at the unemployment rate right now, it's south of almost 3.6%. Contrast that to the previous recession where it was north of 14%.

So for that reason, we think that is one of the reasons why you're seeing that the housing market is cooling off, but it's not dropping off the cliff. And also, we have to keep in mind that we are in a housing shortage right now. For the past decade, there has been an under construction, which hasn't kept up with population growth.

- But just to follow on that very quickly here because in the event that people are, and households still have that savings, are they starting to tap into that savings is the question? Because not everybody is looking at their home equity and saying, all right, well to solve all the financial problems I might have, or to really get ahead of it, I'm just going to put my house up for sale.

- Yes. So people are starting to tap into their savings, people are prioritizing their spending. They're spending less on brands and more generic things, they're spending more on services. So they're prioritizing their spending. But at the same time for every unemployed person, we have two jobs available. The labor market is strong, the consumer spending is strong, and 70% of our GDP is consumption. So that's why we feel a recession, even if it happens, it's not going to be very severe.

313,2022-07-06T10:47:59+00:00,Stock market news lives updates: Stock futures drift as growth concerns grip markets,"U.S. stock futures drifted sideways Wednesday morning, with equities struggling for direction as the risk of a recession remained top of mind for many investors.

Contracts on the S&P 500 fluctuated between small gains and losses, and edged higher by less than 0.1% about three hours before the opening bell. Futures on the Dow and Nasdaq also moved slightly to the upside during a choppy pre-market session.

Crude oil prices held below $100 per barrel after falling below that threshold for the first time since mid-May on Tuesday, as investors increasingly bet that a downturn might weigh on demand for energy. Bitcoin prices rose back above $20,000. And Treasury yields climbed across the curve, though the benchmark 10-year yield edged just above 2.82% to hover near its lowest level in about six weeks.

Prospects of a deep economic downturn have stoked ongoing volatility in markets, as investors weigh whether inflation and a more aggressive Federal Reserve tightening cycle will curb growth to the point of tipping the economy into a recession. And some key economic data, from consumer sentiment to spending and purchasing managers' indices, have each softened or turned lower in recent prints.

""A broad-based slowdown in overall consumer spending has already been underway this year, led by deterioration in the goods category, with services providing little in the way of offset,"" Barclays' Jonathan Miller wrote in a recent note. And as sentiment indexes from the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index to University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers decline, he added, that ""may indicate that a more precautionary mindset might be setting in, which would make households more inclined to hoard excess savings accumulated during the pandemic.""

Whether — and if so, when and how deeply — a recession takes hold has become a key question for market watchers and has left the stock market languishing in a bear market.

""For the last several months, the market's been watching the economy choke on inflation,"" Matt Kishlansky, GenTrust Head of Asset Allocation, told Yahoo Finance Live. ""There's really no consensus between the stock market and the bond market as to what we do in the interim and where we're headed.""

Story continues

In the bond market, the 10-year Treasury yield has slid from a more than decade high of over 3.4% in mid-June to below 2.9%. And Fed Funds futures have shown investors are now pricing in a lower terminal rate for the Federal Reserve — or the rate at which the Fed will stop hiking short-term interest rates — than they were just a couple weeks ago.

""So if you try to reconcile those two numbers, the bond market's telling you that before the ink is even dry on the last interest rate hike, the Federal Reserve is going to have to start cutting rates in order to deal with the economic fallout from those rate hikes,"" Kishlansky added. ""[The] bond market's, in essence, saying that a recession is a fait accompli at this point. The stock market's not so sure.""

317,2022-07-05T12:23:00+00:00,Stock market news lives updates: Stock futures fall as recession concerns linger,"US stock futures traded lower Tuesday morning, reversing course after last Friday's gains as concerns over the potential for a deeper economic downturn persisted.

Contracts on the S&P 500 dropped by nearly 1% as traders returned from a long holiday weekend. The Dow was on track to drop by more than 250 points, or 0.8%, and Nasdaq futures shed 1.2%.

Energy prices came under renewed pressure, and West Texas intermediate crude oil futures dropped to below $108 per barrel. Treasury yields steadied after last week's slide, and the benchmark 10-year yield steadied above 2.9%.

Concerns over inflation, and whether higher prices might catalyze a downturn in the economy, or spur the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy aggressively at the expense of economic growth, have kept a weight on equities even amid short-lived bear market rallies. Federal Reserve officials have so far maintained their hawkish stances, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in public remarks last week that there was “no guarantee” the Fed could avoid a hard landing.

Amid these lingering jitters, the S&P 500 has so far posted its worst start to a year since 1970, and the Dow since 1962, with each of the major averages sliding by double-digit percentages since the start of 2022. And already, the US economy has shown some signs of softening, with consumer confidence sliding and short-term expectations sinking to a near decade-low, and spending falling for the first time this year in May.

""Last week's data performance, including a downward revision to Q1 GDP and evidence of sustained deceleration in consumer spending, suggests the US economy is clearly losing momentum in the face of soaring inflation and tightening financial conditions,"" Sam Bullard, Wells Fargo senior economist, wrote in a note Tuesday.

Further critical economic data is due out this week, including Friday's non-farm payrolls report. Economists are looking for a more tepid 275,000 jobs to have come back in June, which would mark a sharp slowdown from the prior month's 390,000. And the unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 3.6%, for just a tick above February 2020's pre-pandemic low of 3.5%. And on Wednesday, the Federal Reserve is poised to release the minutes of its June meeting, which set the stage for the central bank's most aggressive move yet on inflation this cycle, with its first 75 basis point rate hike since 1994.

Story continues

""The current hawkish tone should be pervasive throughout following the actions of a stepped-up 75 basis point federal funds rate hike and the explicit commitment to continue tightening aggressively until officials see 'clear and convincing' signs that inflation is coming down to target,"" Wells Fargo's Bullard said. ""We will be on the lookout for clues as to what inflation evidence officials are monitoring to help make that call.""

319,2022-07-01T11:39:13+00:00,Stock market news lives updates: Stock futures fall as July begins with more selling,"US stock futures fell Friday morning, extending this week's losses and kicking off the first session of July with more selling.

Contracts on the S&P 500 dipped by about 0.3% in early trading. Dow and Nasdaq futures each dropped about 0.4%. West Texas intermediate crude oil futures rose back above $107 per barrel after logging the first monthly decline since November 2021 in June. And the 10-year Treasury yield held below 3% to hover near its lowest level in about three weeks.

Markets are limping into July and the second half of the year amid widespread concerns over whether the economy can remain resilient in the face of inflation and the Federal Reserve's aggressive response to inflation. The S&P 500 closed out its worst first half of the year since 1970 on Thursday, sliding more than 20% so far in 2022. The Dow's 15.3% decline so far this year marked its worst first half since 1962, and the Nasdaq Composite's 29.5% plunge represented its worst first half on record.

The backdrop has remained challenging, with signs of a slowdown in US growth mounting in both the economic data and in company results and anecdotes. And Federal Reserve officials have so far telegraphed they would allow the economy to continue softening to a degree if it meant achieving their current primary goal bringing down inflation.

Semiconductor bellwether Micron Technology on Thursday offered a current-quarter sales forecast that came in far below Wall Street's estimates, suggesting customers were pulling back on ordering memory chips widely used in computers and smartphones in anticipation of weakening demand among consumers. And just a day earlier, furniture company RH slashed its own revenue forecast, citing a ""deteriorating macro environment.""

Inflation, especially for essentials like gas and food, has remained elevated, pressuring consumers' propensity to spend. Real personal spending fell more than expected as of May, new data this week showed. But the full impact of inflation on corporate profits has likely not been fully reflected in earnings estimates to date, many strategists have argued, suggesting further volatility for equities. The next quarterly reporting season is set to pick up in the middle of July.

Story continues

""Inflation right now is on the minds of everyone, whether it's a consumer, corporation, and policy makers. But after that, it's really earnings,"" Ryan Nauman, Zephyr market strategist, told Yahoo Finance Live on Thursday. ""So far, earnings estimates ... haven't come down at all.""

The next catalyst for markets ""could be earnings, once we start getting some earnings downgrades, which are expected,"" he added. ""Right now, a recession isn't priced into a future earnings. And I think that's going to happen. We could see some pickup in volatility or some more sell-offs once we start getting into earnings season and to more downgrades.""

On the move

Kohl's (KSS) shares sank Friday morning after the retailer said it was ending discussions to be sold to Franchise Group, the parent company of The Vitamin Shoppe. ""Given the environment and market volatility, the Board determined that it simply was not prudent to continue pursuing a deal,"" Peter Boneparth, chair of the Kohl's board, said in a statement.  Micron Technology (MU) shares dropped after the company issued a current-quarter forecast that came in far short of consensus estimates, leading to a slew of lowered price targets for the stock among major Wall Street firms. The firm said it expected adjusted revenue would total between $6.8 billion and $7.6 billion, versus the $9.14 billion consensus analysts were expecting, according to Bloomberg data. Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) shares edged up Friday morning as the stock steadied after sinking to reach its lowest intraday level since December 2020 a day earlier. Walgreens reported better-than-expected quarterly results on Thursday but highlighted a waning boost from COVID-19 vaccines, and the company maintained its full-year outlook.

320,2022-06-30T11:51:33+00:00,"Stock market news lives updates: Futures fall, S&amp;P 500 heads for worst first half in 52 years","US stock futures tumbled Thursday morning, with the major averages on track to post steep declines for the month of June and first half of 2022 as concerns over heightened inflation and the prospects of a recession weighed on risk assets.

Contracts on the S&P 500 shed about 1.4% as of 7:45 a.m. in New York, and the index paced for a third straight day of losses. Dow futures dropped more than 350 points, or 1.2%, and Nasdaq futures declined by about 1.6%.

The risk-off mood extended to other asset classes including oil. West Texas intermediate crude futures fell back below $110 per barrel, and bitcoin prices sank to just over $19,000.

Thursday's early price action extended a streak of declines for US equities. These have been hit hard for months now as investors have weighed persistently hot inflation against risks of an economic downturn, as the Federal Reserve responds to inflation with faster tightening. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell this week reaffirmed that the central bank's main goal is bringing down inflation running at its fastest rate in over 40 years, suggesting that this aim will take priority over fully preserving activity elsewhere in the economy. NEW YORK, NEW YORK - JUNE 23: Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange during morning trading on June 23, 2022 in New York City. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)

“Is there a risk we would go too far? Certainly there’s a risk,” Powell said at the European Central Bank’s annual economic policy roundtable conference in Portugal on Wednesday. “The bigger mistake to make — let’s put it that way — would be to fail to restore price stability.”

Powell earlier in June suggested either a 50 or 75 basis point interest rate hike would most likely be on the table following the Fed's July meeting. And in the weeks since, a number of other key central bank officials have affirmed that the latter will probably be the most appropriate option, with inflation showing few signs yet of peaking and consumer inflation expectations remaining elevated. Fresh economic data due out later Thursday morning is expected to show that headline personal consumption expenditures (PCE), one of the key inflation gauges that includes changes in gas and food prices, jumped at a 6.4% annual rate in May after April's 6.3% clip.

Story continues

Amid the myriad concerns facing markets as of late, stocks are on track to close out the worst first half of a year in decades. Based on Wednesday's closing prices, the S&P 500 is set to post a 19.9% decline for the first six months of the year — its worst performance since 1970. For the month of June alone, the index is on track to slide by 7.6%.

All 11 major sectors in the index are heading toward monthly losses, with the cyclical energy, materials and financials sectors among the worst performers as fears over a recession have resurged. That leadership also reversed what was seen earlier this year, when energy stocks and outperformed amid oil and other energy commodities' march higher. The more defensive health-care, consumer staples and utilities sectors outperformed in June.

Both the Dow and Nasdaq Composite also headed for marked monthly and year-to-date losses. As of Thursday's close, the Dow had fallen 14.6% for the first half of the year, and the Nasdaq shed nearly 29%.

On the move

Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) shares shed more than 4% in pre-market trading to extend losses after a more than 23% decline in the stock on Wednesday. The retailer reported same-store sales that sank more than 20% in the most recent quarter, and also announced CEO Mark Tritton would be leaving the company and the board, effective immediately, and that board member Sue Gove would take over on an interim basis. RH (RH) shares tumbled after the furniture company slashed its full-year outlook to forecast a revenue decline, citing ""the deteriorating macro-economic environment"" and lower-than-expected demand. RH now sees revenue falling between 2% and 5% this year, versus a prior outlook for sales to come in flat to up 2%. Constellation Brands (STZ) gained slightly Thursday morning to outperform the broader market after the beverage company posted first-quarter results that exceeded estimates on most major metrics. Comparable earnings per share came in at $2.66 versus the $2.50 expected, according to Bloomberg data, and beer net sales of $1.9 billion were $160 million better than expected.

324,2022-06-29T13:00:44+00:00,Stock market news live updates: Stock futures extend declines as inflation weighs on confidence,"US stock futures fell Wednesday morning to build on Tuesday's losses, as investors remained focused on mounting signs of a slowdown in US economic growth.

Contracts on the S&P 500 fell by about 0.2% Wednesday morning following a 2% slide in the index a day earlier. Dow futures edged lower, and Nasdaq futures shed about 0.3% as technology stocks remained under pressure.

Bitcoin also declined, and prices briefly fell below $20,000. West Texas intermediate crude oil futures rose above $112 per barrel for the first time in two weeks, while the 10-year Treasury yield dropped below 3.2%.

The latest bout of volatility across markets came amid renewed jitters over inflation's impact on growth prospects in the US economy. On Wednesday, first-quarter US GDP was revised down to show a 1.6% annualized contraction, as personal consumption came in weaker than previously reported. And a separate report earlier this week showed a slide in US consumer confidence to a 16-month low and a deterioration in short-term expectations to a 9-year low, raising concerns that consumers will curb spending in anticipation of persistently high prices.

Given these and other recent reports, some Federal Reserve officials have flagged the risk that inflation expectations will become entrenched among consumers, making the case for the central bank to maintain its hawkish posture for now.

""The fact that the salient prices of gasoline and food remain elevated suggests that there is some risk that longer-term inflation expectations of households and businesses will continue to rise,"" Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta Mester said in remarks Wednesday.

She suggested she would back another 75 basis point interest rate hike in July if economic conditions look similar through the Fed's meeting next month, echoing the support of other officials as of late for such a hike. Markets are currently pricing in a more than 80% probability that a 75 basis point rate hike will ultimately occur in July, according to CME Group data.

Story continues

These expectations for a series of larger-than-typical rate hikes have remained a point of pressure for technology stocks especially, which are valued heavily on prospects for future earnings growth. The Nasdaq Composite remains firmly in a bear market, down 28.5% for the year-to-date, and both the tech-heavy information technology and communication services sectors within the S&P 500 have lagged the broader index.

""Inflation fears remain, and the Fed is gonna have to step in more aggressively and drive up interest rates further, and that's very, very bad for tech stocks,"" Opimas CEO Octavio Marenzi told Yahoo Finance Live on Tuesday. ""The Fed is not finished with its interest rate hikes by any stretch of the imagination ... I'm not expecting any turnaround anytime soon here. I think this is a down market that's got some legs.""

Pinterest (PINS) shares rose during pre-market trading after the company said Google and PayPal executive Bill Ready will take the place of Pinterest co-founder Ben Silbermann as CEO of the social media platform. Analysts have suggested Ready's experience suggests he may help further Pinterest's expansion plans to build out shopping capabilities on its platform. Nio (NIO) shares tumbled Wednesday morning to extend losses after short-seller Grizzly Research issued a report claiming the electric car-maker was involved in ""accounting shenanigans"" to meet financial targets. Nio responded with a statement saying the report ""is without merit and contains numerous errors."" Upstart Holdings (UPST) shares fell sharply Wednesday morning after Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock to Underweight from Equal-Weight and cut the firm's price target to $19 per share from $88 seen previously, according to Bloomberg. Morgan Stanley suggested the consumer lending platform would come under pressure due to the cyclical nature of the business.

325,2022-06-28T11:44:48+00:00,Stock market news lives updates: Stock futures rise as choppy trading persists,"US stock futures rose Tuesday morning to shake off some early-week losses, as markets continued a choppy stretch of trading.

Contracts on the S&P 500 rose about 0.6% in pre-market trading, after ending Monday slightly in the red. Dow and Nasdaq futures each also rose by about 0.6% ahead of the opening bell. US crude oil prices rose above $111 per barrel, and the 10-year Treasury yield jumped back above 3.25% to approach last week's highs.

Major US-listed Chinese stocks rose in New York trading Tuesday morning after China cut in half its required quarantine times for travelers, in a sign the country may be loosening its most stringent COVID zero policies that had acted as a risk to growth. Chinese internet companies including Alibaba (BABA) and Baidu (BIDU) rose in early trading, and stock indexes in Asia and Europe broadly gained.

US equity investors remain closely attuned to signs of an economic deceleration in the US, with inflation continuing to run at multi-decade highs and monetary policymakers maintaining a firm stance that their priority remains bringing down prices even at the expense of some growth. Closely watched data from the University of Michigan last Friday suggested consumers were at least beginning to temper their expectations for how hot inflation will run in the near-term, however, helping contribute to a stock rally that closed out the S&P 500's second-best week of 2022.

With quarterly corporate earnings season set the pick up in the next few weeks, the focus will soon shift to how companies have been navigating persistent inflation alongside early indications of softening demand. As of Friday, consensus Wall Street strategists were still predicting S&P 500 earnings would grow, in aggregate, by 10.4%, according to FactSet. Some have indicated this estimate will need to be revised down to fully reflect inflation's impact to margins, and the effects of an otherwise softening economy. Semiconductor bellwether Micron (MU) is set to report earnings later this week, with the pace of the earnings reports set to pick up in mid-July.

""I think we're gonna have a second half that's frustrating the bulls and frustrating the bears, bouncing around a bunch as we kind of digest the economy slowing,"" Bob Doll, Crossmark Global Investments chief investment officer, told Yahoo Finance Live. ""How much of an effect does that have on earnings? Maybe we get a little better inflation news so the [price-earnings ratio of the S&P 500] doesn't get threatened as much. But we're moving from a period where it's all been about PEs multiples declining. And we're moving to a period where I think the earnings are gonna be watched more carefully than the PE.""

On the move

Nike (NKE) shares dipped in early trading after the athletic apparel-maker offered a disappointing full-year outlook, reflecting in large part ongoing concerns over sales trends in its business in China. Sales in Greater China fell by 20%, excluding currency impacts, in Nike's latest quarter. Nike said it expects revenue will grow by a low double-digit percentage this year, with gross margins flat to down by 50 basis points. Robinhood's (HOOD) stock fell by 3.5% during the pre-market session, giving back some gains after rallying by 14% in its best day in over a month on Monday following a report that FTX might be considering a deal to buy the trading platform. Sam Bankman-Fried, the CEO and founder of FTX, told Yahoo Finance, however, that ""there are no active M&A conversations with Robinhood."" Kezar Life Sciences (KZR) shares nearly doubled after the company announced ""positive results"" from a phase 2 clinical trial for its drug aimed at treating treading lupus nephritis. The stock was on track for its best session since June 2020 based on early price action.

327,2022-06-24T14:28:48+00:00,Consumer sentiment falls to record low in June as inflation persists,"Consumer sentiment hit a record low in June as Americans continued to face elevated prices for gas, food, and other goods and services.

The University of Michigan's closely watched Surveys of Consumers consumer sentiment index was revised lower to 50.0 in the final June survey.

This marked the lowest level on record in data for the series, which spans back to the mid-1970s. In the preliminary monthly survey, the index registered 50.2.

Inflation, which last increased at the fastest pace in more than 40 years as of May, remained a pressing concern and a key contributor to the further erosion in sentiment.

""The final June reading confirmed the early-June decline in consumer sentiment ... Consumers across income, age, education, geographic region, political affiliation, stockholding and homeownership status all posted large declines,"" Joanne Hsu, director of the Surveys of Consumers, said in a statement.

""About 79% of consumers expected bad times in the year ahead for business conditions, the highest since 2009,"" Hsu added. ""Inflation continued to be of paramount concern to consumers; 47% of consumers blamed inflation for eroding their living standards, just one point shy of the all-time high last reached during the Great Recession."" Gas prices are advertised at a Chevron station as rising inflation and oil costs affect the consumers in Los Angeles, California, U.S., June 13, 2022. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson

The final consumer sentiment index for June represented a marked decline from May's reading of 58.4.

Inflation expectations for the year ahead remained elevated at 5.3%, while long-run inflation expectations moderated, falling to 3.1% from the preliminary report's 3.3%.

Mahir Rasheed, US Economist, at Oxford Economics, said this decline in long-run inflation expectations was ""encouragingly lower"" than the preliminary reading, noting that Fed chair Jerome Powell called this figure ""quite eye-catching"" in testimony earlier this week. Rasheed notes, however, this ""remains the highest expected long-run rate of the current cycle.""

The University of Michigan's print also came following a number of other reports pointing to a deterioration in key parts of the US economy and a slide in sentiment among businesses. The preliminary S&P Global Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for June came in at 51.2, the weakest level since January, and S&P's manufacturing output index slid into contractionary territory and a two-year low.

Story continues

Business confidence has slumped to ""a level which would typically herald an economic downturn, adding to the risk of recession,"" Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said Thursday.

Last week, a Conference Board survey found that 60% of CEOs said they expect a recession before the end of 2023. Economics teams at Wall Street firms from Goldman Sachs to Citigroup have also raised their expectations for the risk of a recession over the next year, mostly due to their anticipation that the Federal Reserve would have to keep hiking interest rates swiftly to bring down inflation.

Consumers also still expect inflation to remain elevated, though one-year inflation expectations were revised slightly lower in the latest print. The University of Michigan's revised data showed consumers anticipate inflation will rise 5.3% versus the 5.4% previously reported, which had matched March and April's readings for the highest since 1981.

""Consumers also expressed the highest level of uncertainty over long-run inflation since 1991, continuing a sharp increase that began in 2021,"" Hsu said.

329,2022-06-24T11:33:34+00:00,Stock market news live updates: Futures rise as indexes head for weekly gains,"US stocks rose Friday morning, with the S&P 500 on track to end a three-week losing streak as investors digested the Federal Reserve officials' latest affirmations that they remained committed to bringing down inflation.

Contracts on the S&P 500 rose by about 0.8% in early trading, setting the index up for a back-to-back day of gains and its first weekly advance since late May. Dow futures rose by more than 200 points, or 0.7%, while Nasdaq futures increased by nearly 1% ahead of the opening bell.

The major US averages have traded choppily this week, but ultimately trended higher as investors considered the ongoing economic impact of the Fed's moves to bring down rising prices. Fed Chair Jerome Powell made his most explicit acknowledgement yet this week that a recession was ""certainly a possibility"" — albeit not the ""intended outcome"" — as the central bank hiked interest rates further this year.

""Really, investors want the chair to understand that inflation is a significant problem and that dealing with it earlier is actually better for the long-term,"" Diane Jaffee, group managing director and senior portfolio manager of TCW Group, told Yahoo Finance Live on Thursday. ""So I think investors are taking heart that the Fed is going to do whatever it takes.""

Still, Powell's nod to current recession risks tracked with increased warning signals from a series of Wall Street firms that have recently raised their own forecasts for the probability of a near-term recession. Powell's assertion that the Fed's commitment to bringing down inflation was ""unconditional"" also suggested the central bank would not stop hiking rates at the first signs of an economic slowdown.

Defensive stocks seen as more resilient during downturns advanced this week, with the healthcare and utilities sectors among the biggest outperformers in the S&P 500. Cyclical sectors lagged, with the energy and materials sectors each heading for weekly losses. West Texas intermediate crude oil futures hovered near $106 per barrel and headed for a third straight weekly loss, as well as its first monthly loss since November.

Story continues

Treasury yields increased across the curve to steady after renewed recession concerns also sent yields tumbling earlier this week. The benchmark 10-year yield rose back above 3.10%, after topping 3.31% at the start of the week. NEW YORK, NEW YORK - JUNE 14: Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on June 14, 2022 in New York City.

On the move

FedEx (FDX) shares rose by more than 2.5% in early trading after the shipping giant delivered a full-year forecast that exceeded Wall Street's estimates, while meeting fiscal fourth-quarter profit expectations. FedEx sees full-year adjusted earnings per share coming in between $22.50 and $24.50, compared to the $22.36 seen by analysts, according to Bloomberg. FedEx Chief Customer Officer Brie Carere noted on the company's earnings call Thursday they were anticipating business-to-consumer shipping volumes to come under some pressure next year as consumer spending continues ""tilting towards services from goods."" Zendesk's (ZEN) stock skyrocketed by more than 50% during the pre-market session after the Wall Street Journal reported that the software company is nearing a deal with a group of buyout firms including Hellman & Friedman and Permira. The private-equity takeover could be firmed in the coming days if talks progress, according the the Wall Street Journal. CarMax (KMX) shares added more than 1% in early trading after the used vehicle retailer posted first-quarter results that topped expectations. Earnings per share of $1.56 on revenue of $9.31 billion were exceeded estimates for earnings of $1.51 per share and revenue of $8.99 billion, according to Bloomberg data. Total retail used vehicle unit sales were down 11% compared to last year, however, which CarMax said came as a result of ""a lapping of stimulus benefits paid in the prior year period; widespread inflationary pressures, including challenges to vehicle affordability; and waning consumer confidence.""

330,2022-06-23T17:45:00+00:00,Will SPY Lose Its Asset Crown?,"The king of all ETFs could be dethroned as soon as next year, based on current market trends.

The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), the first U.S.-listed exchange-traded funds, is on track for its fourth net outflow in six years, while competing funds like the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV), the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) and the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), continue to gather assets at a rapid clip.

SPY, a revolutionary product that launched in 1993, has stood atop the hierarchy for much of its history. There have been a handful of challengers. In January 2001—amid the implosion of the dot-com bubble—the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) held $26.7 billion in assets versus SPY’s $27.8 billion.

Then in August 2011, with the eurozone sovereign debt crisis raging and days after S&P Global downgraded the credit rating of the United States, assets under management in the SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) reached $76.7 billion, topping SPY’s AUM of $76.5 billion at the time.

Not Real Contenders

These challenges to SPY’s asset leadership were overcome each time, and they never surpassed the fund and maintained the No. 1 spot.

An ETF solely targeting Nasdaq stocks and a fund holding gold could never compete with a broad market ETF tracking the most widely followed index in the financial markets.

But it’s a different story for IVV, VOO and VTI. These ETFs offer nearly identical exposure to SPY—a bit broader in the case of VTI—with expense ratios that are one-third of the first ETF, 0.03% versus 0.09%.

They are beloved by long-term investors, most of which add money into the ETFs day after day, year after year, regardless of market gyrations. The same can’t be said of SPY, which has registered net outflows since 2017.

IVV The Closest Competitor

Currently, IVV, with $277 billion in assets under management, is the closest to matching and eventually surpassing SPY in AUM. It’s followed by VTI with $245 billion and VOO with $241 billion.

Story continues

Assets Under Management

With $57 billion separating the Nos. 1 and 2 ETFs, it’s more likely we’ll see the flip sometime in 2024 or even 2025, rather than in 2023—though there’s an outside chance it could happen next year. IVV gained $37 billion on SPY so far this year, $31 billion in 2020 and $35 billion in 2018.

All three of the challengers for the throne—IVV, VTI and VOO—have had inflows of more than $100 billion over the past 5 1/2 years, compared with outflows of $16 billion for SPY.

Flows By Year ($M)

Ticker 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 Total SPY -21,507 37,899 -24,581 -2,071 -16,507 10,580 -16,188 VOO 24,368 46,901 21,432 12,451 13,938 14,792 133,882 VTI 12,436 44,460 32,623 15,390 9,823 8,313 123,046 IVV 15,104 28,578 6,350 8,592 18,546 30,237 107,407

If current trends persist, all three of them will be larger than SPY within the next few years.

SPY’s Not Going Anywhere

Even if SPY falls down the ETF leaderboard, its place in ETF history is secured, and so is its place as the most liquid ETF in the world. It trades 100 million shares per day, 15 times more than its rivals. It also has a much deeper and more liquid options market.

These are advantages that probably won’t go away anytime soon, if ever, even after IVV, VTI and VOO become the larger ETFs.

No. 1 in assets or not, SPY is here to stay.

331,2022-06-23T17:29:22+00:00,6 Dividend Income Stocks With Better Yields Than the S&amp;P 500,"These are six dividend income stocks with better yields than the S&P 500. The S&P 500 has a dividend yield of approximately 1.60% from a practical standpoint.

The reason this is so is that the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY) trades for $374.64 as of June 23, and its training 12-month (TTM) dividend payment is $6.01. That gives it a dividend yield of 1.60%. The Wall Street Journal reports that the actual index yield is 1.76%. But you cannot make that unless you buy an index fund like SPY or else own all 500 stocks separately.

The recent SPY quarterly dividend payment was $1.58. That works out to $6.32 annually. But that is only if the quarterly dividends were all at the same level. That is not what happens with the SPY dividend. They vary each quarter. So the TTM dividend payment is the best way to measure the S&P 500 yield from a practical, comparable standpoint.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Therefore, these six stocks have better yields than the S&P 500 as measured by the SPY ETF (i.e., 1.60%). They also have enough earnings to cover their dividends. Moreover, these six stocks have outperformed the SPY index, which is down 21.63% YTD. They also have lower price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios. The WSJ reports that the S&P 500 P/E ratio is just over 20 times (20.33x, as of June 23).

Market Cap: $231.487 billion

Merck & Co. (NYSE:MRK) a large pharmaceutical stock with a 3.26% dividend yield, which is higher than the SPY index yield of 1.60%. So far this year MRK stock is up 19% YTD, as of June 23, which outperforms the 21.63% negative performance of the SPY index.

Story continues

Moreover, its yield is higher than its 2.93% 4-year average yield, implying a 4.4% higher stock price. On top of that, Merck is forecast to make $7.39 in earnings per share (EPS) this year and $7.42 next year, according to a survey of 22 analysts by Seeking Alpha. That shows that its earnings more than cover the annual $2.76 dividend payments at Merck.

It also shows that MRK stock has a much lower P/E at slightly over 12 times earnings. This compares to 20.33 (as mentioned above) with the S&P 500.

So MRK stock has a better yield, a well-covered dividend, a lower P/E, and better performance than the S&P 500. This is as seen in a comparison with the SPY ETF. That makes it one of the better dividend income stocks.

Market Cap: $131.8 billion

Raytheon Technologies Corp (NYSE:RTX) is a defense and aerospace contractor that has good earnings growth, a higher dividend, and a lower P/E multiple than the S&P 500. For example, as of June 23, RTX has a dividend yield of 2.38%, at a $2.20 annual dividend payment on a stock price of $92.56 per share. This is well above the SPY dividend yield of 1.60%.

Moreover, given that RTX stock has a forward P/E multiple of 19.4x for the year ending December 2022. Since earnings are forecast to move 20.9% higher from $4.77 in 2022 in 2023 to $5.77 per share, the P/E multiple falls to just 16x. Both of these multiples are lower than the 20 times S&P 500 multiple.

7 Bargain Income Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever

In addition, it is clear that the $4.77 EPS more than covers the annual $2.20 dividend payment. Moreover, analysts expect RTX stock to rise 28% to $116.86 per share. This makes RTX one of the best dividend income stocks on this list.

Cabot Corporation (CBT) Detail of chemical plant, silos and pipes

Market Cap: $3.414 billion

Cabot Corporation (NYSE:CBT) is a specialty chemicals company whose stock is up over 9% YTD. This compares to the 21.6% decline in the S&P 5o0 (SPY) as of June 22. Moreover, CBT stock has a 2.36% dividend yield vs. the 1.60% dividend yield of SPY ETF and 1.76% of the S&P 500.

On top of this, Cabot is much cheaper than the S&P 500. For example, analysts project that it will make $6.12 for the fiscal year ending Sept. 2022. This is forecast to grow 17.6% in the coming year to September 2023 to $7.20 per share, based on the average of a survey of six analysts.

That also puts CBT on a forward multiple of 10.2x September 2022 FY earnings and 7.2x September 2023 FY earnings. That is significantly cheaper than the 20x S&P 500 index multiple.

And, of course, it goes without saying that Cabot’s earnings more than cover the $1.48 dividend payments. Cabot has made dividend payments consecutively for the past 32 years, so it’s likely to keep doing so.

Lastly, analysts project that the target price for Cabot stock is $85.50 per share, according to a survey of five analysts by Refinitiv(Yahoo! Finance). That is 37.3% over today’s price of $60.50 as of June 23.

Avnet (AVT) The logo for Avnet (AVT) is seen on the side of a building.

Market Cap: $4.048 billion

Avnet (NASDAQ:AVT) is up 3.1% YTD compared to the 21% decline in the S&P 500. Avnet is an electronics distributor that is forecast to show nominal growth.

But AVT stock has a low 6.85x multiple of earnings for 2022 and 7x for 2023. This is well below the 20x P/E of the S&P 500.

In addition, AVT’s 2.45% dividend yield is well above the 1.60% SPY dividend yield. It also has plenty of free cash flow (FCF) to cover the dividend.

For example, last quarter ending April 30, it produced $232.2 million in FCF. That covered its dividend payment of $25.6 million as well as share repurchases of $43.4 million.

Dividend Income Stocks: Resources Connection (RGP) a person holds up a scrap of paper that asks ""Are you covered?""

Market Cap: $606.811 million

Resources Connection, Inc. (NASDAQ:RGP) is an interesting consulting firm that provides services in transactions (e.g., integration and divestitures, bankruptcy/restructuring, going public) and regulations (accounting, audit, compliance, etc.).

The company is consistently profitable and has paid a dividend consistently over the past 11 years. Right now its dividend yield is 3.03% with an annual dividend of 56 cents on its price today of $18.33 (June 23). This is well above the S&P (SPY) yield of 1.60%.

Moreover, the stock is up 3.49% YTD, compared to the 21.6% fall in SPY stock. Moreover, analysts forecast earnings this year (to May 2022) of $1.72 and lower earnings for the year to May 2023 of $1.66. That puts its P/E multiple at just 11.3x. Again, this is much more inexpensive that the S&P 500 multiple of 20x.

Analysts project a price target of $22.33 based on a survey by Refinitiv of three analysts. That presents a potential upside of 19.4%. This makes RGP stock one of the best dividend income stocks on this list.

Chevron Corp (CVX) CVX stock

Market Cap: $276.92 billion

Chevron Corp (NYSE:CVX) is a large integrated oil and gas company. CVX stock is up almost 24% YTD, compared to the average 21% decline of the stocks in the S&P 500 index as seen by the SPY ETF. And, of course, no wonder since the prices of oil and gas have skyrocketed, pushing up inflation across the global economies.

Nevertheless, analysts still believe that prices will abate next year, lowering Chevron’s profitability. But this is not to the point where it will not be able to afford its ample dividend.

For example, right now Chevron pays an annual dividend of $5.68 per share, but analysts forecast that EPS will fall from $17.23 to $14.97 (almost $15 per share). That means earnings will still be well over 2.5x the dividend it pays out. This also gives CVX stock a dividend yield of 3.84%, over twice that of the SPY index at 1.60%.

7 Long-Term Stocks That Never Go Out of Style

Analysts still have a higher price target for CVX stock of at least $180.59, or over 22% over today’s stock price of $140.78. All this makes CVX stock one of the best dividend income stocks on this list.

""We are, again, starting to see some signs of demand softening, which is exactly what we want,"" Harker told Yahoo Finance's Brian Cheung Wednesday morning.""We don't want it to crash. We want to bring the economy into a safe position and in balance with supply and demand.""

Harker's comments suggest the economy has already started to show signs of cooling following the Fed's interest rate hikes unleashed so far this year, which has brought the Fed Funds rate to between 1.50% and 1.75%.

Harker, an alternate member of the Federal Open Market Committee this year, voted in favor of the central bank's 75 basis point interest rate hike last week.

A 'couple quarters' of negative GDP

A further softening in demand in the U.S. economy could help bring down inflation, which is currently running at its hottest level in 40 years, back to the Fed's 2% target. And if evidence of a moderation emerges, the Fed may not need to raise interest rates as swiftly as it did this month, Harker suggested.

""I'm not ready to make a final decision ... exactly where I am between 50 and 75 [basis points],"" he said. ""If we start to see demand soften — and we are seeing some signs that demand is starting to soften in certain sectors of the economy. And if it's softening quicker than I anticipate, then it may be appropriate to go with a 50. If it's not, then it's probably appropriate to go with the 75. But let's see how the data turns out in the next few weeks.""

One of the main concerns for market participants, however, has been over the extent to which larger-than-typical interest rate hikes might ultimately disrupt the economy, or tip the economy into recession.

""We could have a couple of negative quarters [of GDP growth],"" Harker said. ""But I think the situation we're in right now is — and this word is overused — unprecedented. But I really think it is unprecedented. We came into this pandemic with a very tight labor market and a very strong economy. We still have very tight labor markets. So the historical examples that you would rely on in this situation don't quite fit. This is unique, so I think we have to recognize that and execute policy based on what we're seeing, not based on some historical example.""

Story continues

In recent days, severalmajor Wall Street banks have penciled in an increased risk of a recession, largely on concern that the Fed will hike interest rates to the point of tipping the economy into a downturn in order to rein in inflation.

Two negative quarters of gross domestic product (GDP) growth are seen by many investors as a recession, though the National Bureau of Economic Research makes the final call on ""official"" U.S. recessions.

Last week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a press conference that a 50 or 75 basis point increase ""seems most likely"" following the central bank's July meeting given the current inflationary and economic backdrop, while adding the goal was to still avert tipping the economy into a recession in the process.

And in the days since Powell's comments, other FOMC officials have already signaled support for another rate hike of this magnitude. Richmond Federal Reserve President Thomas Barkin said Tuesday that guidance for a 50 or 75 basis point interest rate hike in July ""feels pretty reasonable,"" while noting his rate outlook could be adjusted depending on how the economy evolves over the coming weeks.

""I think we've been very clear that we need to move to a restrictive stance,"" Harker told Yahoo Finance Live. ""How we get there is dependent on the data. So we can't be that precise, [with] what we're going to be doing in September or December right now. I mean, the data will dictate that.""

340,2022-06-21T11:57:46+00:00,Stock market news live updates: Stock futures rise after S&amp;P 500's worst week since March 2020,"U.S. stock futures rose Tuesday morning as traders returned from a long weekend, with equities looking to steady following the S&P 500's worst week since March 2020.

Contracts on the S&P 500 advanced by about 1.7% during pre-market trading to pare some losses after plunging by 5.8% last week. Nasdaq futures rose by a similar margin, and Dow futures added nearly 500 points, or 1.6%.

Bitcoin (BTC-USD) rose back above $21,000 after a cryptocurrency rout briefly sent prices below $18,000 for the first time since December 2020 over the weekend. Treasury yields climbed, with the benchmark 10-year yield increasing to nearly 3.3%, and U.S. crude oil prices rose by 1.5% to top $111 per barrel.

Tuesday's early recovery rally across risk assets came as an at least brief respite amid weeks of heavy selling. The S&P 500 sank into its first bear market since the height of the pandemic last week, and the sell-off ramped even further after the Federal Reserve unleashed a larger-than-typical 75 basis point interest rate hike and signaled it would be willing to tighten further and at the expense of some economic growth to bring down rampant inflationary pressures.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is set to deliver his semi-annual address before Congress on Wednesday and Thursday, during which he is likely to be pressed by lawmakers about the Fed's actions to bring down inflation and the extent to which these may weigh on the economy.

And already, concerns over the resilience of the economy have risen sharply. A number of economists at major Wall Street firms downgraded their growth forecasts over the past several days to reflect an increased risk of a recession. A recession is typically defined as two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth, though the final call is made by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER).

""The most likely outlook is very weak growth and persistently high inflation,"" Bank of America economists wrote in a note Friday. ""We see roughly a 40% chance of a recession next year. Our worst fears around the Fed have been confirmed: they fell way behind the curve and are now playing a dangerous game of catch up.""

Story continues

Others have been even more bearish. Deutsche Bank's base case calls for a recession to begin in the third quarter of 2023, following sluggish real GDP growth of just 1.2% in the U.S. in 2022, versus the 1.8% seen previously. Goldman Sachs economists ""now see recession risk as higher and more front-loaded,"" the firm's chief economist Jan Hatzius said in a new note. He raised his recession probability to 30% from 15%.

Rising risks of a formal recession in the U.S. economy also leave the S&P 500 vulnerable to more downside, even after a more than 22% slide so far for the year-to-date. The S&P 500's bear market slides since World War II have averaged 29.6% with an average duration of 11.4 months, according to data from LPL Financial's Ryan Detrick. However, when bear markets coincide with recessions, the S&P 500 tends to fall 34.8% on average at its bear market trough and last nearly 15 months.

Gainers

Kellogg (K) shares jumped more than 8% Tuesday morning after the company announced it planned to split into three separate companies. The newly spun out firms will comprise a separate global snack foods company, a North American cereal firm, and pure-play plant-based foods company. Tesla's (TSLA) stock gained after CEO Elon Musk said the company's head count would only be reduced by as much as about 3.5% in the near-term, or a smaller percentage than previously expected. Musk confirmed that 10% of salaried workers at Tesla would be cut over the next three months, but that ongoing hiring would keep the net reduction to just 3-3.5%, he told Bloomberg News Tuesday. Amazon (AMZN) shares gained more than 2% in pre-market trading as badly beaten-down tech stocks recovered some recent losses. The stock has fallen in 10 of the past 12 weeks as investors have rotated away from pandemic-era tech and growth winners seen as among those vulnerable to rising rates.

Decliners

Adobe (ADBE) shares dipped after Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock to equal weight from Overweight and slashed its price target to $362 from $591 per share, or the lowest among major Wall Street firms, according to Bloomberg. Analyst Keith Weiss cited his expectations for structurally slower growth for the company as reason for the downgrade, which came on the heels of Adobe's latest earnings report last week.

343,2022-06-17T11:54:05+00:00,"Stock market news lives updates: Stock futures rise, but indexes still head for steep weekly losses","U.S. stock futures rose Friday morning as equities at least temporarily paused a downward slide, as concerns over the prospects of a recession remained elevated.

Contracts on the S&P 500 rose by about 1% before the opening bell after the index slid to its lowest level since Dec. 2020 a day earlier. The S&P 500 headed for a weekly loss of 6% — its worst since March 2020.

Dow futures gained more than 200 points, or about 0.8%, in early trading. And futures on the Nasdaq rose more than 1% as the 10-year Treasury yield pulled back to about 3.2%.

Even given Friday's early gains, the major averages remained on track to post steep weekly losses as traders considered the likelihood and timing of a potential recession. While signals of an economic slowdown have been brewing for months now, heightened fears of a more significant downturn resurged in just the past week alone. That came especially after last Friday's Consumer Price Index showed inflation remained at multi-decade highs even following the Federal Reserve's initial moves earlier this year to raise interest rates and bring down demand and prices.

And with the Fed now turning even more aggressive — starting with its first 75 basis point interest rate hike since 1994 on Wednesday — the potential for a slide in economic activity as the central bank trades some growth for lower inflation appears increasingly likely.

""The market is reevaluating what the odds of a recession are in the near-term and what the actual downside on earnings and what the recession will really look like,"" Ross Mayfield, Baird investment strategy analyst, told Yahoo Finance Live on Friday. ""But to me, it's a fairly kind of tidy story about higher interest rates, more aggressive Fed, and multiple times in the past that leads to some sort of financial crisis or recession. I think the market's trying to price the odds of that.""

And that pricing recalibration has so far brought the S&P 500 24% below its Jan. 3 record closing high. But stocks likely still have further to fall if history is any indication, some strategists said.

Story continues

Deutsche Bank, one of the first major banks to call for a 2023 recession earlier this year, pointed out that the S&P 500's current decline from its peak is so far in-line with the median drop seen amid recessions post-World War II. Currently, it's the fourth worst non-recession correction over that period, Deutsche Bank's Jim Reid said in a note Friday morning. But when recessions materialize, bear markets for stocks tend to deepen.

""The timing of the recession is a hot topic at the moment. When it hits, both [Binky Chadha, Deutsche Bank chief U.S. equity and global strategist] and I would expect the S&P 500 to be down -35 to -40% from the highs,"" Reid said. ""The rationale from [Chadha] being that the initial overvaluation was more extreme than normal cycles, with my additional comment being that this recession marks a regime shift from decades of declining inflation to higher structural levels. This deserves a bigger de-rating than average."" NEW YORK, NEW YORK - JUNE 16: People walk by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on June 16, 2022 in New York City.

Centene (CNC) shares gained after the healthcare company raised its full-year guidance ahead of its investor day. The company now sees adjusted earnings per share coming in between $5.55 and $5.70, up from a prior range of between $5.40 and $5.55. Amazon (AMZN) shares rose Friday morning to shake off a 3.7% drop on Thursday amid a drawdown in Big Tech names. The company also announced its 2022 Prime Day sales event will take place on July 12 and 13 this year. American Express (AXP) shares gained after Baird upgraded the Dow component as well as peer payment companies Capital One, M&T Bank and Fifth Third to Outperform from Neutral, according to Bloomberg. Baird noted that the ""risk/reward finally [looks] attractive for bank and card names"" in the wake of the latest selling pressures for the space.

Adobe (ADBE) shares declined after the company slashed its full-year revenue outlook to account for greater tax and currency headwinds, and the impact of its decision to end sales in Russia and Belarus amid the war in Ukraine. The company now sees full-year sales totaling $17.7 billion compared to a prior outlook for $17.9 billion. Advent Technology (ADN), a fuel cell and hydrogen technology developer, saw shares sink more than 10% in early trading. The move came a day after the stock skyrocketed by more than 200%, after the company announced it received a funding notification for about $821 million for a fuel cell development project in Greece.

The S&P 500 was down 3.2% to 3,670 by midday, more than reversing Wednesday’s post-Fed 1.5% relief rally. With the day’s losses, the index is now lower by 22.4% on a year-to-date basis—a historically horrible return.

If the year ended here, the S&P 500 would register its worst annual decline since 2008 and its second-worst annual decline since 1974. On a total return basis, the index lost 37% in 2008 and 26.5% in 1974.

The S&P 500 dropped by 22.1% in 2002, the year in which the index troughed following the busting of the dot-com bubble.

What makes this year’s decline in stocks especially perilous is there has been no counterweight from bonds, which typically rise in times of market and economic stress. But this time around, surging inflation and a hawkish Fed have sent bonds in the opposite direction, negating their traditional safe haven role.

The Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index is down by 11.7% year to date, its worst decline ever.

Losses Across The Board

The one-two punch of declining stocks and bonds has taken a toll on ETFs across the board. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) is down by 22.7% year to date, while the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) is lower by 26.1%.

Meanwhile, the iShares Core US Aggregate Bond ETF (AGG) has lost 11.8%; the iShares 7-10 Year Treasury Bond ETF (IEF) is lower by 13%; and the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) is down by 25.2%.

Corporate bond ETFs like the iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (LQD) and the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (HYG) shed 17.4% and 13.7%, respectively.

Rare bright spots have been the SPDR Gold Trust (GLD), which is hanging on to a 1% gain, and other commodity-focused funds, like the United States Commodity Index Fund (USCI), the United States Oil Fund (USO) and the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE), which are up by 39.4%, 62.1%, and 40.1%, respectively.

348,2022-06-16T11:48:40+00:00,Stock market news lives updates: Stock futures slide amid renewed recession concerns,"U.S. stock futures fell Thursday morning as investors weighed the potential economic costs of the Federal Reserve's ongoing fight with inflation.

Contracts on the S&P 500 fell by more than 2% in early trading, reversing course after rising 1.5% on Wednesday. Contracts on the Nasdaq declined by more than 2.5%, and Dow futures sank by more than 500 points, or 1.8%. The 10-year Treasury yield rose to about 3.44%, hovering near its highest level since 2011.

Stocks, which moved initially to the upside following Fed's first 75 basis point rate hike since 1994 on Wednesday, turned around as traders assessed the potential that the central bank's moves to bring down inflation would trigger a deeper downturn in economic activity.

The Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) on Thursday showed the committee itself now sees a less rosy economy ahead as its continues to hike interest rates. The FOMC now anticipates the unemployment rate will come in at 3.7% by the end of this year (versus the 3.5% rate seen in March), and that real gross domestic product will rise just 1.7% (versus the 2.8% increase seen previously). The Fed also raised its forecast for the rate of core inflation at year-end and its expectation for where the Fed funds rate would end 2022.

The lowered growth outlook coupled with a more aggressive path on interest rate hikes ahead appeared to vindicate some pundit's concerns that the Fed's window to achieve a ""soft landing"" had nearly or already passed. Fed Chair Jerome Powell suggested Wednesday that a 50 or 75 basis point interest rate hike seemed most like at the central bank's next meeting in July. While the Fed is still forecasting GDP growth will end each of 2022, 2023 and 2024 in positive territory, some suggested this may be overly optimistic.

""The Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) and Chair Powell’s presser highlighted a Committee that sees an increasingly narrow path to a soft landing, while still maintaining that as a baseline,"" Matthew Luzzetti, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank, wrote in a note. ""The statement removed the reference to maintaining a strong labor market as inflation is brought under control and the SEP anticipates that the unemployment rate will eventually rise by about half a percentage point. We continue to anticipate that the Fed will have to move more aggressively than signaled at [Wednesday's] meeting and that this tightening will trigger a recession in 2023 that leads to a more material rise in the unemployment rate.""

Story continues

Powell, for his part, said Wednesday that the Fed was not looking for a recession to achieve the central bank's goals of bringing down inflation. However, whether such an outcome is ultimately avoidable as a byproduct of the Fed's moves remains a question for markets, and one that will likely keep volatility at play, some strategists said.

""'Clear and convincing' evidence of moderating inflation has yet to materialize ... Further volatility is likely with the Fed firmly data dependent,"" Julian Emanuel, senior managing director at Evercore, said in a note. ""Ideally, this will include equities reflecting signs of capitulation, the groundwork for 'a' bottom is being laid.""

""Until further necessary and sufficient signs (gasoline price turn and VIX [spikes above 40] on heavy stock volume) of 'a' bottom, not necessarily 'the' bottom appear, we maintain balanced exposure,"" he added.

On the move

Gainers

Twitter (TWTR) shares rose Thursday morning ahead of Elon Musk's highly anticipated all-hands meeting with the social media company's employees later in the day. Details from the meeting will be watched closely for signs over whether Musk intends to move ahead with the deal to acquire the company at its previously discussed $44 billion price tag.

Decliners

Robinhood (HOOD) shares were on track to slide anew on Thursday amid the recent drop in cryptocurrency prices, and as Wall Street firms struck an increasingly pessimistic tone on the online trading platform's stock on increased regulatory concerns. Atlantic Equities downgraded the stock to Underweight from Neutral on Wednesday and slashed its price target to the lowest on Wall Street at $5 a share, Bloomberg data showed. Adobe (ADBE) shares declined before the company's fiscal second quarter earnings report, which is set for release Thursday after market close. Consensus analysts see the software company delivering adjusted earnings of $3.31 per share on revenue of $4.35 billion. Beyond Meat (BYND) shares gave up gains on Thursday after soaring 14% a day earlier amid a rebound in the broader markets, and after the company announced an expansion of its retail outlet availability. Beyond's stock declined by more than 3% in early trading.

""Be careful what you wish for,"" 22V Research Founder Dennis DeBusschere on Yahoo Finance Live (video above). ""You want to take it to an extreme. Let's go 100 basis points, 200 basis points, or 400 basis points. Let's crush the economy. I don't think that would be a path to market stabilization.""

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid

If the Fed delivers a massive rate hike in one shot — or a series of 100 basis point increases — it could badly stunt economic growth at a time when inflation would still likely stay high, and that likely wouldn't be a recipe for markets to climb out of their current bear market land with authority.

The WSJ previewed the Federal Reserve policy decision on Monday night, strongly suggesting that a 75 basis point rate hike was on the table after the surprisingly hot Consumer Price Index (CPI) on Friday.

Market participants had previously generally assumed that a 50 basis point rate hike was most likely as the Fed looks to tackle red-hot inflation.

The story led to Wall Street scrambling to recalibrate rate expectations.

""And yes, 100 bps tomorrow, in July and thereafter would be better,"" Ackman said in a tweet Tuesday night. ""The sooner the @federalreserve can get to a terminal FF rate and thereafter can begin to ease, the sooner the markets can recover.""

Gundlach followed with his own tweet about a 200 basis point increase: ""The Federal Reserve should raise the Fed Funds rate to 3% tomorrow, in my opinion.""

DeBusschere stressed that there is ""so much emphasis on how much more they need to tighten or not, [but] what we really need to know is: The financial conditions tightening we have seen — which would include stocks going down and which would include spreads going wider — is that enough to slow economic growth and achieve the Fed's goal for the markets to stabilize? If the answer to that is No, we have a lot more downside risk. That is the unfortunate situation we find ourselves in.""

BRIAN SOZZI: OK, since 1950, only three years has the S&P 500 finished a year down more than 20%. According to LPL Financial's Ryan Detrick, they were 1973, 2002, and 2008. Maybe a little hope there from Ryan Detrick. And this year, though, is shaping up to be the fourth, with the S&P 500 down about 21% year to date.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/p-500-track-finish-down-140720919.html,"['GSPC.INDX', 'SPY.US']",[],"{'polarity': 0.678, 'neg': 0, 'neu': 0.926, 'pos': 0.074}"
354,2022-06-15T11:49:47+00:00,Stock market news lives updates: Stock futures rise as traders brace for Fed decision,"U.S. stock futures rose Wednesday morning as investors looked ahead to the Federal Reserve's latest monetary policy decision.

Contracts on the S&P 500 gained about 0.8% in pre-market trading, and the index looked to end a five-day losing streak. Nasdaq futures increased by more than 1%, and Dow futures gained about 0.6%. Treasury yields declined, and the benchmark 10-year yield pulled back from a more than decade-high to below 3.4%. Bitcoin prices (BTC-USD) took another leg lower to sink to a fresh Dec. 2020 low of just over $20,000.

Stocks slid and bond yields spiked this week as traders raced to price in the impact of a supersized interest rate hike from the Fed. The central bank is now widely expected to raise its benchmark interest rate by 75 basis points for the first time since 1994.

The likelihood of such a hike had been seen remote as recently as mid-last week, especially since Fed Chair Jerome Powell said clearly in May that policymakers were not actively considering an increase greater than 50 basis points. However, in the weeks since, the economic data have suggested the Fed's more measured moves have so far done little to address inflation, which set a fresh 40-year high in May. And other recent data showed consumers' inflation near-term expectations have crept to near or all-time highs.

""Given the gravity of the situation with inflation as it is now, even though it's kind of a surprise relative to what we've heard from the Fed in terms of what they said they were going to do, it looks like it's the right move,"" Tom Simons, Jefferies money market economist, told Yahoo Finance Live on Tuesday. ""The markets are going to feel more confident about the Fed's credibility in terms of their ability to limit inflation. And overall, it's going to lead to a better positive outcome for the economy in the long run."" Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on June 14, 2022 in New York City. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)

Others, however, have been less supportive of a 75 basis point hike and cast doubt about whether it would ultimately be a net positive for the economy. The risk of the Fed over-tightening, or raising interest rates more swiftly than markets and the economy can adjust to, could ultimately do more damage than good, some pundits argued.

Story continues

""Our objection to this more aggressive action is that it is unnecessary, because the forces which have driven the recent inflation numbers are already fading,"" Ian Shepherdson, chief economist for Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a note Wednesday.""Slower wage gains, along with the rollover in the housing market, will depress rent growth, while airline fares are likely to fall over the summer in the wake of falling jet fuel prices, and vehicle prices will drop as inventories rise.""

""The inflation fix will not be more effective if the Fed hikes by 75bp [basis points] today or next month, rather than 25bp, and the damage done to private sector wealth could inadvertently trigger a downturn which otherwise would be averted,"" Shepherdson added. ""Less is not always more, but sometimes it is enough.""

The Federal Reserve's monetary policy decision is set for 2 p.m. ET, with a press conference from Powell beginning at 2:30 p.m.

On the move

Gainers

Nio (NIO) shares were on track to rise for a back-to-back session on Wednesday ahead of a product launch event set for 8 p.m. ET. The company also suggested a new electric-vehicle model was coming, teasing a new product launch with a countdown clock on its website. Boeing (BA) shares added to Tuesday's gains after the company said it delivered a total of 35 aircraft in May, more than doubling last year's tally of 17. The majority of these were for its lucrative 737 Max jet. Separately, The Seattle Times, citing a Federal Aviation Administration official, reported Boeing may be able to resume 787 Dreamliner deliveries in the coming weeks. Baidu (BIDU) shares rose after Reuters reported the Chinese internet giant has been in talks to sell its majority stake in streaming business iQiyi. The deal could reportedly value the firm around $7 billion.

Decliners

Coinbase (COIN) headed for a seventh consecutive day of losses amid the ongoing price declines for the major cryptocurrencies. If maintained, this would mark Coinbase's longest losing streak since January. Chevron (CVX), Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC), and other energy stocks dipped to track a dip in oil prices Wednesday morning. These moves came after the International Energy Agency said Wednesday in its new monthly report that global oil supplies will struggle to keep pace with demand next year, as sanctions against Russia take full effect at the same that China recovers from its recent COVID outbreak.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

- About a quarter to noon here on the East Coast. Let's check in on stocks. Yahoo Finance's Ines Ferre, who's got the latest for us on all of the market action-- mixed bag, I see right now, Ines.

INES FERRE: A mixed bag, Brian. The market's attempting a little bit of a rebound, but we are seeing right now that the Dow is down about 3/10 of a percent. The NASDAQ is in the green, and the S&P 500 is lower. Just taking a look at the five-year [? T-note, ?] we are seeing it up 6 basis points at 3.53%, higher than the 10-year, which is at 3.43%, and the 10-year higher than the 30-year, which is at 3.4%.

Let's take a look at some of the trending tickers on our Yahoo Finance page. We are seeing Oracle-- that's the number one trending ticker-- up more than 8% after its quarterly results came in better than expected. And FedEx, after announcing a dividend raise, up 13%.

Taking a look under the hood at where we are with our sectors. We're seeing energy stocks, which are leading right now. Energy was one of the big laggards yesterday, although all the sectors yesterday were in the red. But we're also-- that's also been followed by now technology, consumer discretionary. You've got utilities and consumer staples that are in the red right now.

Over on the Dow, we're watching P&G, Coca-Cola, as I mentioned. Consumer staples down more than 3%, lagging. And then over on the NASDAQ, we're watching Tesla, up more than 2%. Finally, just want to mention what's happening with the Chinese ADRs because we are seeing a lot of green here for these Chinese stocks, guys.

- And, Ines, we saw a lot of the travel names get hit especially hard yesterday, although you could argue nobody really escaped the sell off. What are we seeing today?

INES FERRE: Nobody was spared from yesterday's sell off. That's right. We are seeing some of the travel names a little bit under pressure here. You've got Trip that's up more than 9%, Trip.com.

But we are seeing a little bit of the continued pressure for these airlines. Some interesting data coming out of Adobe Analytics, saying that, in May, online bookings fell 2.3% from the previous month. So we may be seeing a little bit of demand destruction as the airfare prices have really gone through the roof this year.

- OK. Ines Ferre, thanks so much for that.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/stocks-oracle-rises-fedex-soars-160923935.html,"['3V64.F', '3V64.XETRA', 'AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'AMZ.F', 'AMZ.XETRA', 'AMZN.MX', 'AMZN.US', 'AMZO34.SA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA', 'DJI.INDX', 'FDX.F', 'FDX.MX', 'FDX.US']",[],"{'polarity': -0.557, 'neg': 0.052, 'neu': 0.905, 'pos': 0.043}"
357,2022-06-14T11:52:56+00:00,Stock market news lives updates: Stock futures steady after bear market slide as rate decision looms,"U.S. stock futures moved slightly higher Tuesday morning as the major averages steadied following a plunge that sent the S&P 500 into its first bear market since the height of the pandemic.

Contracts on the S&P 500 rose by about 0.2% during early trade, paring some of Monday's losses after the index dropped to its lowest level since Jan. 2021. The S&P 500 entered its first bear market since March 2020 on Monday, as its closing price put it more than 20% below its recent record closing high from Jan. Contracts on the Dow and Nasdaq also advanced during pre-market trading.

The benchmark yield on the 10-year Treasury note pulled back by about 7 basis points from Monday's 11- year high to hover around 3.3%. The monetary policy-sensitive two-year yield also eased after spiking to its highest level since 2007. Oil prices rose, and U.S. West Texas intermediate crude oil futures broke back above $122 per barrel. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) remained under pressure as prices held just over $22,000.

Volatility resurged across markets at the start of the week as investors raced to price in a greater likelihood of a larger interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve as it races to address inflation. Market participants expect the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will raise interest rates by the 75 basis points this week, with CME Group data showing Tuesday morning that traders were pricing in a more than 90% probability of such an outcome. The FOMC begins its two-day policy-setting meeting on Tuesday, with a decision and press conference from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell set for Wednesday. NEW YORK, NEW YORK - JUNE 03: Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) at the start of the trading day on June 03, 2022 in New York City. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)

Expectations for a much larger-than-typical rate hike soared after the Wall Street Journal reported Monday that a 75 basis point hike was on the table among Fed officials. And talk and market pricing of such a hike had already been building after Friday's much hotter-than-expected May CPI print, and after separate surveys in the days since showed consumers' near-term inflation expectations were increasing to levels at or near all-time recorded highs.

Story continues

""The Fed’s previous plan to hike by 50bp [basis points] at the meetings in June and July and then revert to 25bp increases in the fall was always dependent on inflation showing signs of cooling,"" Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note Tuesday. ""Instead, the monthly gains in core CPI accelerated back to 0.6% in both April and May, suggesting that price pressures are broadening.""

And other recent reports further suggested businesses' concerns over inflation remained elevated. The latest NFIB Small Business Optimism survey Tuesday showed inflation remained the top problem reported among small business owners. And the share of business owners raising their own selling prices rose to match a record high in the 48-year-old survey.

On the move

Gainers

Oracle (ORCL) shares jumped more than 11% in early trade after the software company topped fiscal fourth quarter earnings and sales estimates in results delivered Monday afternoon. Cloud licensing revenue drove the beat as sales in that unit jumped 18%. Twitter's (TWTR) staff is set to hear from Elon Musk this week, with the billionaire set to make his first appearance at a Twitter all-hands meeting since first announcing his $44 billion plan to buy the social media company in April, Insider reported Tuesday. Shares rose during the pre-market session. Kaival Brands (KAVL) shares soared in early trading after the vaping products distributor announced it reached a deal with Phillip Morris to develop and distribute electronic nicotine delivery system products outside the U.S.

Decliners

MicroStrategy (MSTR), Coinbase (COIN), Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) and other crypto-linked stocks declined for another session Tuesday as major cryptocurrency prices dipped further. Netflix (NFLX) shares were on track for a fourth day of losses after the firm Benchmark cuts its rating on the streaming company to sell from hold, Bloomberg reported Tuesday morning. Day One Biopharmaceuticals (DAWN) shares slid after the company said it began a public offering of $125 million shares of its common stock.

358,2022-06-13T15:00:38+00:00,Fed survey shows inflation expectations match highest on record,"U.S. households' expectations for inflation over the coming year rose to match the highest recorded level on record in May, according to new data from the New York Fed.

The NY Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Expectations released Monday showed consumers in May anticipate inflation will rise at a 6.6% rate over the next year, up from an April reading of 6.3%. May's reading tied with March's print for the highest on record, in data spanning back to June 2013.

Longer-term inflation expectations were slightly more subdued last month, with consumers looking for inflation to average 3.9% over the next three years. This expectation, however, is still well above the Fed's 2% target. These longer-term expectations were unchanged from April. Consumer expectations for inflation next year matched the highest level since at least 2013 in May, data from the NY Fed showed Monday. (Source: New York Federal Reserve)

This data further complicates the job of the Federal Reserve's task to bring down rising prices and prevent expectations from becoming embedded among consumers.

The NY Fed's report comes just days after government data showed an unexpected pick-up in the pace of price increases across the U.S. economy. Friday's Consumer Price Index (CPI) registered an 8.6% annual increase, or the biggest since 1981, as prices for energy, food, shelter and a variety of other goods and services each saw further gains.

Over the weekend, gas prices at the pump jumped above $5 per gallon on average across the U.S. for the first time ever, AAA data showed, further pressuring consumers already squeezed by broad-based price rises.

And amid these rising prices, consumer sentiment has plummeted. The University of Michigan's Surveys of Consumers consumer sentiment index slumped to an all-time low reading of 50.2 in the preliminary June survey, marking the lowest level recorded by the survey dating back to the mid-1970s.

The University of Michigan's latest data on consumer inflation expectations also showed an increase, mirroring the rise in the New York Fed's report.

According to the university's survey, consumers in early June anticipated inflation would rise 5.4% over the next year, matching March and April's readings and marking the highest levels since 1981. UMich data also showed long-term inflation expectations on the rise, hitting 3.3% this month, the highest since at least 2010.

359,2022-06-13T11:28:34+00:00,"Stock market news lives updates: Stock futures slide as inflation, rate hike jitters mount","U.S. stock futures traded sharply lower Monday morning, with traders betting a fresh decades-high print on inflation will force the Federal Reserve to get even more aggressive than previously anticipated to help ease rising prices.

Contracts on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 slid more than 2% and touched the lowest levels since November 2020 during the overnight session. Dow futures sank by more than 500 points, or about 1.7%. Treasury yields rose across the curve, and the benchmark 10-year yield jumped to its highest level since late 2018.

Investors nervously looked ahead the Federal Reserve's latest policy-setting meeting later this week, with a rate decision set for Wednesday. Up until Friday's hotter-than-expected monthly Consumer Price Index, traders widely believed the meeting would set the stage for another half-point rate hike by the central bank, bringing the target range for interest rates between 1.25% and 1.50%. However, after last week's data showed an unexpected pick-up in inflation to a fresh 40-year high of 8.6% in May, investors have raised their bets on an even bigger move by the Fed.

Fed funds futures, which help track traders' predictions for where the Fed's target interest rate band will land, shifted quickly after Friday's report and showed increased bets on an even more pronounced 75 basis point hike. As of Monday, Fed funds futures priced in an about 25% probability of three-quarter point hike and an around 75% probability of a 50 basis point hike, according to CME Group data. As recently as mid-last week, investors were pricing in a more than 90% probability that the Fed would opt for a 50 basis point rate hike.

""There is very little in the details of [Friday's CPI] report to suggest that inflationary pressures are easing,"" Michael Pearce, senior U.S. economist for Capital Economics, wrote in a note Friday. ""The surge in energy prices this month means that headline inflation will remain close to 8.6% in June. Together with the continued strength of the latest activity data, that bolsters the argument of the hawks at the Fed to continue the series of 50 bp [basis point] rate hikes into September and beyond, or even to step up the size of rate hikes at coming meetings.""

Story continues

Such a super-sized rate hike would add more pressure to already-volatile stocks by further raising the cost of borrowing for businesses. But at the same time, equity markets have also remained in turmoil as investors have had to weigh whether inflation left to run at current decades-high rates will push the economy into a deeper downturn. Already, at least one survey has shown consumer sentiment plunged to its lowest level since at least the 1970s in the face of rising prices. And given all these uncertainties, the Fed may well choose to continue down its previously telegraphed path to implement only half-point hikes in the near-term, some economists said.

""This is not a quick process. But we also don't want to disrupt the capital markets. And so I think moving steadily, in terms of 50 basis points, which is the messaging they've been giving the market, is the right course of action,"" Hal Reynolds, Los Angeles Capital chief investment officer, told Yahoo Finance Live on Friday. ""And they're going to be data-driven, and they can continue to do that into the fall.""

Video Transcript

JULIE HYMAN: Lakshman Achuthan is with us now to talk more about all of this, Economic Cycle Research Institute co-founder.

LAKSHMAN ACHUTHAN: Hi.

JULIE HYMAN: So what you do is in the name of the organization. Economic cycles is where your expertise lies. So are we going into a recession? When is it happening? How should we be thinking about this, especially with the numbers this morning?

LAKSHMAN ACHUTHAN: Sure, well, I think these numbers reinforce our earlier outlook that odds are we are going to go into a recession. The question as to when is just not yet. But, I mean, it's super tantalizing. But it's there because of the kind of information that we're seeing today.

Right, the Fed is going to be super hawkish. I think we just concluded that, right, as a result of these continuing highs in inflation. So that makes for a really odd mix. You don't have to be an economist to figure this out, right?

The economy is slowing, consumer confidence at a record low. You don't to hear that. At the same time the Fed is stomping on the brakes. What's going to happen, right? The odds are you could slow too much.

And they really just have a choice of policy mistakes or errors. There's no right way out of this. We wrote back in January that because they were so late in going after inflation and slowing things down, they now are trying to make up for it or catch the train. But the inflation train left the station a long time ago. And we're seeing that built here.

So as a result, the US Fed, other central banks around the world, everybody's tapping on the brakes. We're all going to slow. And I we all know the odds are really high here of a recession.

BRIAN SOZZI: Mild recession or something bruising?

LAKSHMAN ACHUTHAN: First off, I just want to say it's super hard to predict a recession. I know a lot of people are predicting. I just got to tell you, it's super hard to do this. We have a pretty good record of doing it. And so I think it's meaningful that we're saying that there's a recession in front of us.

Story continues

Now, as to mild or severe, a lot depends on the nearby shocks, right? By definition, you don't know what they are. We think we know what they are, right? Some pretty shocking things have happened. And they may persist to make a recession more severe.

On the other hand, you might say, well, some consumers have money saved up. Some businesses have decent balance sheets.

JULIE HYMAN: And most people have jobs.

LAKSHMAN ACHUTHAN: And most people, and most people have-- well, the job market's pretty tight, let's say. So therefore, this could mean a mild recession. I don't think that's knowable just yet.

One of the things that we're seeing from our research, because we do look at 22 economies around the world, is that there is a setup for a more severe recession, a more international recession. And the last time we had that would have been the early '80s, which is after the inflation of the '70s. So there you go.

- And so within that context, as we're thinking about where this leaves employees, but also consumers, because at the end of the day, those employees are daily basis consumers on everything from gas to food items. And they're looking across the board at where those price increases are being felt. So in the wake of or at least leading up to a recession, how they're feeling is going to be even more so priced into the markets well ahead of the actual recession showing up in the GDP print.

LAKSHMAN ACHUTHAN: Yeah, yeah, yeah, 100% right. And I'm glad you brought up, what do consumers do, right? First off, as you were saying, job market's hot. If you don't have your dream job, get your dream job. If you're in it, hang on to it. Just solidify yourself. It's a really good time to be doing that, number one.

Number two, save for a rainy day. If you can, start to sock away or beef up your savings a little bit because things are likely to get more volatile. A growth rate cycle slowdown, just a simple garden-variety slowdown, you can get 10%, 20% corrections in equities. A recession, you're more in bear market territory.

And when you go back to the consumers, let's oversimplify and say there's lower income as a half or more and then upper income to various stages is the other side. Lower income, very strapped already, right, because it's rent. It's food. It's energy. It's everything that you need takes up the whole budget.

Wealthier consumers may have some exposure to equities or home prices that have been rising. If those start to wobble, they get a little edgy and start to pull back. And you'll see it. Even though nominal numbers can look good, the company is going to come out and say, oh, look, nominally we did these blowout numbers.

Look at the actual amount of stuff, right? There's less chips in the bag even though the bag still costs 2 bucks. And people will start to move on discretionary things. You won't use a fresh can of tennis balls every game. You'll use them for a few games. That's the kind of stuff that starts to seep in.

JULIE HYMAN: You said a moment ago that the ingredients are in place to potentially have a worse global recession. What are those ingredients? Walk us through what would need to happen to get there.

LAKSHMAN ACHUTHAN: OK, so we enter this recessionary window of vulnerability, where I think we're edging toward that pretty clearly. Then you have shocks that are occurring inside the window of vulnerability. We already have the energy shock. If it persists, that verifies. That could be part of what makes the recession sharper.

You could have a market event. That's a type of shock. You could have a geopolitical event. Look at what's going on in Europe. I mean, I know it's slipped a little off of the major headlines, but that's still percolating.

Those kinds of impacts you see coming full circle and in today's report. Food is up. Energy is up. So these are the kinds of things-- and there's some interesting things happening with currencies and these central banks around the world. There's things that can move very fast.

In the summer of '08, August of '08, before Lehman blew up, our international indexes, leading indexes-- now I'm talking forward-looking, where's the puck headed-- those indicators went to recessionary readings. And then Lehman blew up. So that combo in retrospect was the recipe for the Great Recession. OK, we have to wait and see.

BRIAN SOZZI: If we get that recession, who bears the most blame for it? Is it Jerome Powell, the Fed, or the Biden administration?

LAKSHMAN ACHUTHAN: Oh yeah, so look, they both have their fingers near this, right? So you want to support the economy coming out of the pandemic and the deep COVID recession. There was a-- we called an inflation cycle upturn in September of 2020. That's 21 months ago. The Fed hung out with the transitory stuff, keeping that going all the way until November of last year. So that's very late.

And the same thing with the kind of fiscal response. There are things early on that were super helpful. I think people see that. But then more recent stimulus, you're pushing on the gas when the inflation cycle is already running up.

I think the fundamental issue, fundamental, from where I said I study cycles, is that I don't think economic policymakers understand that inflation is cyclical and that that's different than the business cycle. It's a fundamental concept. I think a lot of noneconomists can understand that. But actually, after you've become an expert in modeling, it's a little tougher.

BRIAN SOZZI: Well, on that happy note, let's get some shots. Let's get some shots and have a great weekend.

LAKSHMAN ACHUTHAN: No, no, no, no, no. OK, we've survived all of this stuff in the past. And we're going to survive it again. I have no doubt. And this will set us up for stronger growth. But unfortunately, some of the more vulnerable get hurt during a recession.

BRIAN SOZZI: I like leaving on that. Let's leave it on that note. Lakshman Achuthan, Economic Cycle Research Institute co-founder, good to see you. Appreciate you coming down.

362,2022-06-10T14:41:12+00:00,Consumer sentiment hits record low in June as inflation weighs on consumers,"Consumer sentiment sank to its worst level on record in early June as the rising cost of food, gas, and other essentials weighed on American consumers.

The University of Michigan's closely watched Surveys of Consumers consumer sentiment index slumped to 50.2 in the preliminary June survey, marking the lowest level recorded by the survey, which dates back to the mid-'70s.

Friday's reading marked a drop from May's already-depressed level of 58.4, and missed estimates for a print of 58.1, according to Bloomberg data. Throughout 2019, the last year before the COVID-19 pandemic sent the economy into recession, the sentiment index had averaged around 96.0.

""Consumer sentiment declined by 14% from May, continuing a downward trend over the last year and reaching its lowest recorded value, comparable to the trough reached in the middle of the 1980 recession,"" Joanne Hsu, director of the University of Michigan's Surveys of Consumers, said in a statement.

Consumers' assessments of their own personal financial situations deteriorated sharply and contributed heavily to the overall drop in the index, Hsu noted. Nearly half (46%) of consumers attributed these worsening views to inflation, up from 38% who did so in May.

""This share has only been exceeded once since 1981, during the Great Recession,"" Hsu said. NEW JERSEY, USA - JUNE 7: Gas prices over $5.00 a gallon are displayed at gas stations in New Jersey, USA, on June 7, 2022. (Photo by Lokman Vural Elibol/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)

The University of Michigan's report came shortly after the release of the Bureau of Labor Statistics' latest monthly print on consumer price increases.

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed prices soared by 8.6% in May over last year, representing the quickest annual jump since late 1981. Energy, food and, shelter were the biggest contributors to the broad-based gains in the index, with energy prices up 34.6% over last year and gas prices alone up nearly 49%.

Friday's sentiment report suggested consumers were taken particular note of the gas price gains.

""Half of all consumers spontaneously mentioned gas during their interviews, compared with 30% in May and only 13% a year ago,"" Hsu said. ""Consumers expect gas prices to continue to rise a median of 25 cents over the next year, more than double the May reading and the second highest since 2015.""

Story continues

Consumers also expected inflation more broadly to remain elevated. The University of Michigan's data showed consumers anticipate inflation will rise 5.4% over the next year, matching March and April's readings and marking the highest levels since 1981.

363,2022-06-10T11:19:28+00:00,Stock market news live updates: Stock futures mixed before key inflation data,"U.S. stock futures struggled for direction Friday morning as investors awaited an update on inflation, which is expected to hover near a 40-year high amid elevated prices for gas, food and a variety of other goods and services.

Contracts on the S&P 500 and Dow were each off by about 0.2% in pre-market trading. Nasdaq futures traded flat to slightly higher. Treasury yields rose along the short-end of the curve, while the benchmark 10-year yield steadied around 3.03%. U.S. crude oil prices rose 0.7% to trade above $122 per barrel, holding near the highest level since March.

For market participants, the Bureau of Labor Statistics' 8:30 a.m. release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) will be a key print, offering a fresh look at the extent to which price increases have persisted across the U.S. economy. Consensus economists are looking to see inflation rose 8.3% year-on-year in May, according to Bloomberg, matching April's clip and coming in just a hair below March's more than 40-year high rate of 8.5%.

CPI is also likely to accelerate to a 0.7% month-over-month clip in May from April's 0.3% rise, tracking a surge in gas prices heading into the summer travel season. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is expected to edge down only modestly to a 5.9% annual gain from April's 6.2%.

Inflation has remained a dominant issue for investors, policymakers and the American public this year. Higher prices have threatened to weigh on consumer spending — the key driver of U.S. economic activity — as goods and services become increasingly unaffordable. And inflation has already shown signs of triggering a rotation from spending on some discretionary goods to other purchase areas.

And for investors, inflation has also become a key determinant in the path forward for the Federal Reserve's monetary policies. As the Fed aims to help bring down fast-rising prices, the central bank is widely expected to raise interest rates by another half-point at next week's policy-setting meeting, further increasing the cost of borrowing and doing business for companies.

Story continues

Amid these concerns over inflation's impact on the economy and Fed's next moves, stocks have continued to trade choppily. Each of the three major averages was on track to post a back-to-back week of losses, based on Thursday's closing prices. The S&P 500 headed for a weekly decline of about 2%.

""At the end of the day, markets are just faced with a whole lot of uncertainty right now. And it's not just that inflation story,"" Jack Manley, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, told Yahoo Finance Live. ""We have still some uncertainty, some lack of clarity around what the Fed is going to do. The war in Europe continues to rage. And we know there are new developments happening on that front every few days.""

""There's a lot to digest right now. And without any sort of real clarity on these things, it's hard for markets to meaningfully move higher or lower,"" he added. ""It's all markets really want at the end of the day, is news. And no news is bad news.""

364,2022-06-09T14:08:04+00:00,"Jobless claims hit five-month high, but rising trend not yet 'alarming': Economist","The latest jump in weekly jobless claims isn't quite a surefire sign of more economic pain ahead, according to some economists.

First-time unemployment filings in the U.S. rose more-than-expected in a report out Thursday, reaching 229,000 during the week ended June 4. This marked the highest level for initial claims since mid-January, when the U.S. was still grappling with a surge in Omicron-related virus cases.

Thursday's data also brought the four-week moving average for new claims — which smooths out volatility in the weekly data — up to 215,000, or the highest since February. During the prior week, initial claims came in at 202,000.

Given claims data are reported on a weekly basis, rather than the monthly cadence of the non-farm payrolls report, jobless claims data serves as a closely watched indicator of real-time conditions in the U.S. economy. This high frequency data can also act as an early harbinger of a downturn — but it's too early to make that call just based on Thursday's report alone.

""The trend probably is rising, but it is not alarming,"" Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in an email Thursday morning. ""The trend in claims has risen from the mid-March lows, though we are far from sure that the lowest readings — averaging just 170.5K in the four weeks through the first week of April — were real; we think they were flattered by the seasonals."" Initial jobless claims have been on the rise in recent weeks, with weekly claims at a five-month high and the 4-week average of claims at a four-month high. (Source: FRED)

And indeed, claims have risen notably after reaching a more than 50-year low in March. However, even after the past week's jump, claims are still only marginally above levels from before the pandemic. Claims averaged about 218,000 per week throughout 2019.

And continuing claims, which track the total number of Americans still collecting unemployment benefits on regular state programs, held near multi-decade lows in Thursday's report. These held steady at 1.306 million, bringing the four-week moving average to below 1.32 million, or the lowest since January 1970.

""Overall, beyond weekly moves, levels remain low, although filings have moved up from a 166K reading in March,"" Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist for High Frequency Economics, wrote in a note Thursday morning. ""The data merit watching for any changes in the underlying trend over coming weeks and months.""

Shepherdson, for his part, also suggested claims may stabilize near current levels.

""Next week’s reading likely will be very close to this week’s, but claims should then drop slightly until the end of the month,"" Shepherdson added, noting that planned auto industry shutdowns will likely make this data quite noisy into July.

Others, however, took the message sent by the latest jobs data as more equivocal.

""The rise of initial unemployment claims does fit with anecdotal evidence provided by CEOs that they are closely watching their head counts which often covers up for their actions where they are quietly giving out pink slips,"" Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS, said in an email Thursday.

In recent weeks, we've seen CEOs at major companies ranging from Tesla (TSLA) to Meta Platforms (FB) and Coinbase (COIN) announce layoffs, hiring freezes, or issue warnings on the global economy.

""One thing is for certain, joblessness has nowhere to go but up with inflation boosting costs for every company across the country and cost control measures must be implemented which will likely fall on the backs of labor,"" Rupkey added. ""Jobless claims say the economy is slowing down, but there is uncertainty about whether this recession indicator is making the right call.""

365,2022-06-08T17:13:04+00:00,Twitter set to turn bot data over to Musk: report,"Twitter's (TWTR) board is reportedly set to pull an about-face, offering Elon Musk internal data on hundreds of millions of tweets as it vies for the billionaire to complete his acquisition of the social media company.

Twitter is set to turn over information to Musk capturing more than 500 million tweets, the devices the posts came from, and other information about the account holders, The Washington Post reported Wednesday, citing an unnamed person familiar with the matter.

Such a move would help respond to Musk's repeated demands for more information about the composition of Twitter's user base and the extent of its problem with bots. Musk has challenged Twitter's claims that just 5% of its accounts are bots, calling the way the company calculates fake accounts ""very suspicious"" in a May tweet.

Musk has also said the Twitter deal would remain on hold until he received information, leading some on Wall Street to speculate he may be trying to renegotiate the deal down from its original $44 billion price tag.

Twitter rose rose modestly following the Post's report on Wednesday; Twitter shares have fallen about 15% since Musk's deal to buy Twitter for $54.20 per share was announced per share in late April.

In a letter Monday to Twitter's general counsel Vijaya Gadde, Musk's legal team asserted Musk believed Twitter was ""actively resisting and thwarting his information rights (and the company’s corresponding obligations) under the merger agreement"" by withholding the information. Musk waived his typical right as a buyer to due diligence when he first announced his deal with Twitter in April.

""This is a clear material breach of Twitter’s obligations under the merger agreement and Mr. Musk reserves all rights resulting therefrom, including his right not to consummate the transaction and his right to terminate the merger agreement,"" according to the letter.

Twitter could had over the information to Musk as soon as the end of this week, The Washington Post reported Wednesday.

Story continues

In a response to a Yahoo Finance request for comment Wednesday afternoon, a Twitter spokesperson reiterated the company's statement released Monday in response Musk's letter.

""Twitter has and will continue to cooperatively share information with Mr. Musk to consummate the transaction in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement,"" according to the spokesperson.

""We believe this agreement is in the best interest of all shareholders. We intend to close the transaction and enforce the merger agreement at the agreed price and terms.""

366,2022-06-08T14:22:15+00:00,Mortgage activity hits 22-year low as rising rates bite housing market,"A closely watched gauge of mortgage application activity slid to a more than two-decade low last week, as elevated home prices and rising interest rates dragged further on purchase and refinancing activity.

The Mortgage Bankers Association's (MBA) weekly market composite index tracking mortgage loan application volume sank 6.5% during the period ending June 3. This represented a fourth consecutive weekly decline and extended a 2.3% drop from the prior week.

Refinance applications fell 6% week-on-week and were down 75% compared to the same time last year. Meanwhile, purchases fell 7% from the prior week, and on a seasonally unadjusted basis, were lower by 21% compared to last year.

“Weakness in both purchase and refinance applications pushed the market index down to its lowest level in 22 years,"" Joel Kan, MBA’s associate vice president of economic and industry forecasting, said in a press statement. ""While rates were still lower than they were four weeks ago, they remained high enough to still suppress refinance activity. Only government refinances saw a slight increase last week."" A real estate sign in California

“The purchase market has suffered from persistently low housing inventory and the jump in mortgage rates over the past two months,"" Kan added. ""These worsening affordability challenges have been particularly hard on prospective first-time buyers.”

The MBA's latest report adds to other housing market data underscoring cooling demand as interest rates creep higher. New home sales slid by a much worse-than-expected 16.6% in April to reach a two-year low, while existing-home sales sank to the lowest since June 2020 as the median home listing price soared to a fresh record high of $391,200.

The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage hovered at 5.09% as of the beginning of the month, according to Freddie Mac data released June 2. While that was a tick down from the 5.10% from the prior week, it was still a jump from the comparable week last year, when the rate averaged 2.99%. The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage reached the highest level since 2009 in mid-May at 5.30%.

367,2022-06-08T11:08:22+00:00,Stock market news live updates: Stock futures fall as inflation concerns persist,"U.S. stock futures fell on Wednesday as the major averages looked to give back gains after rising for back-to-back sessions.

Contracts on the S&P 500 fell by about 0.5% in early trading. Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq were off by about the same margin. All three major averages had kicked off this week with gains, rising on both Monday and Tuesday.

West Texas intermediate crude oil prices (CL=F) rose above $120 per barrel and reached the highest level since March, and the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield resumed its climb above 3%. Shares of Target (TGT) headed for a third straight day of losses after the retailer issued another guidance cut and projected more discounts to move through inventory. Meanwhile, Novavax (NVAX) shares soared after the pharmaceutical company won backing from the Food and Drug Administration for its COVID-19 vaccine.

Despite the early-week advances, the major U.S. stock indexes have remained overall choppy as investors weighed individual company warnings on inflation and the macroeconomic backdrop against policymakers' efforts to bring down elevated prices. The Federal Reserve remains in a quiet period ahead of its forthcoming policy-setting meeting next week, which is overwhelmingly expected to set the stage for the central bank to roll out a second 50 basis-point interest rate hike.

And other policymakers also reaffirmed that cooling red-hot inflation pressures remains a key priority. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told senators on Tuesday that she expected inflation to remain high and reaffirmed that she saw price increases as being driven by Russia's war in Ukraine, the pandemic-era shift to goods purchases, and ongoing supply chain issues.

""Watching the market ... as it teeters between inching ahead and pulling back, suggests that until there's a more definitive reading on the inflation front coupled with the Fed's thinking on further rate hikes in September, we can expect this bounce back and forth,"" Quincy Krosby, chief equity strategist for LPL Financial, said in an email.

Story continues

""Given the uncertainty the market has to discount, and not the least how corporate earnings will fare as the economy slows further, having a market that wobbles a bit before it makes up its mind is probably the healthiest course, at least for now,"" Krosby added.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics is poised to release its latest Consumer Price Index on Friday, which is expected to show inflation eased only marginally in May from April's elevated 8.3% rate. Consensus economists are looking for headline inflation to rise at a 8.2% annual rate for May, and by 5.9% excluding food and energy prices.

7:00 a.m. ET: Mortgage applications index falls for fourth straight week, reaching lowest level in over two decades

U.S. mortgage applications slid further last week as elevated home prices and rising interest rates dragged purchase and refinancing activity to the lowest level in over two decades.

Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 1: S&P 500 ETF Top stock trades for SPY

Click to Enlarge

I look at theSPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY) everyday. We had a powerful three-day burst of 80%-plus upside volume last week, setting a bullish tone coming into this week. So far though, it’s been a choppy consolidation period.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

That’s as the S&P trades into a prior support zone — which failed last month — and is holding above the 10-day and 21-day moving averages. Bulls want to see the SPY hold above $407 and the 10-day moving average.

However, they need to see the SPY hold above $405. If it loses $405, it loses momentum and puts $400 or lower back in play.

If the SPY can hold up, next week’s focus will be on $417.50, which is roughly this week’s high. Above that (and thus the 10-week moving average) and bulls could be looking at a push to the $421 level, followed by the 50-day moving average.

Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 2: Apple Daily chart of AAPL

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was trading quite well this week, holding above the 10-day and 21-day moving averages. It even reclaimed the vital $150 level, closing above it on Thursday.

Friday was a different story. The stock fell roughly 4%, breaking back below its short-term moving averages. On the plus side, it’s holding that $144-and-change area. I would like to see a bit more of a catalyst than that, though.

Story continues

From here, bulls want to see Apple reclaim the 10-day and 21-day and preferably clear Friday’s high near $148.

On the downside, a break and close below $144 opens the door down to the $136 to $138 area, where Apple stock hammered out a nice low last month. A test of this area keeps the 2022 low in play, near $133.

Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 3: Lululemon Daily chart of LULU

Click to Enlarge

Source: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider

Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU) delivered a beat-and-raise quarter, but the stock is down slightly on the day. On the plus side, it’s holding its short-term moving averages and hit its highest level in several weeks.

If it can hold above $300 and clear $315, Lululemon stock could power up to the $330 to $335 area. There it finds the 50% retracement and 50-day moving average. Above that opens up significantly more upside.

7 Overlooked Value Stocks to Buy Before Wall Street Catches On

On the downside, a break of the post-earnings low, as well as the 10-day and 21-day moving averages puts the key $285 level in play. Below that and the $265 gap-fill level is vulnerable.

Top Trades for Monday No. 4: Micron Top stock trades for MU

Click to Enlarge

Source: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider

Micron (NASDAQ:MU) looked like it was ready to join Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) with a powerful breakout, but couldn’t get going over $75. That was resistance in back-to-back sessions and marks a key resistance point on the chart.

With today’s tumble, Micron is breaking below too many key moving averages. Now we have to see how it sets up again. Can it reclaim Friday’s high and these key moving averages, putting $75 back in play?

If not, it may have a date with range support down near $65 to $66. Otherwise, it’s caught in the middle of the range and is too much of a coin flip at current levels.

Here are three red flags tossed on the plates of investors this week:

Whales Whining

When JPMorgan (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon speaks, it's often wise for investors to listen. And when the long-time bank CEO warns of trouble ahead, it's best to listen that much more closely.

Speaking at a conference sponsored by AllianceBernstein Holdings on Wednesday, Dimon said the U.S. economy is facing a ""hurricane"" as the Federal Reserve continues its process of normalizing interest rates.

""Right now, it's kind of sunny, things are doing fine,"" Dimon told the conference. ""Everyone thinks the Fed can handle this. That hurricane is right out there down the road, coming our way. We just don't know if it's a minor one or Superstorm Sandy... or Andrew or something like that. And you got to brace yourself.""

To that end, here's what top CEOs are telling Yahoo Finance about a potential recession. JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon, wearing ""Seal of the President of the United States"" cufflinks, speaks at the Boston College Chief Executives Club luncheon in Boston, Massachusetts, U.S., November 23, 2021.

Big Tech Warnings

While Salesforce (CRM) offered up a bullish outlook this week, most of the earnings news from big tech has been dour to say the very least.

Microsoft (MSFT) slashed its full year sales and earnings guidance on Thursday, blaming volatile foreign currency markets.

Fellow computing giant Hewlett Packard Enterprises (HPE) dropped its full year profit outlook Wednesday evening. The company said its pullback from Russia and volatile foreign currency markets are weighing on its outlook.

HPE's CFO Tarek Robbiati told Yahoo Finance Live the company is still also dealing with ongoing supply chain challenges (see video above).

Meanwhile, software player C3.ai (AI) also reported a lackluster quarter Wednesday evening. Veteran tech exec and CEO of C3.ai Thomas Siebel told analysts on a conference call customers were delaying orders due to economic uncertainty.

A key bond market player warns

Ratings outfit S&P Global (SPGI) warned on Wednesday of an ""extraordinarily"" weak bond market and suspended its full year forecast.

Story continues

""Macroeconomic conditions have deteriorated since S&P Global last provided financial guidance on May 3, 2022, negatively impacting the Company's expectations for GDP growth and debt issuance volumes,"" the company said.

""Given the volatility and uncertainty in the issuance environment, the Company cannot affirm its previously issued guidance and expects to reintroduce formal financial guidance in conjunction with its second quarter 2022 earnings results,"" S&P Global went on to say.

Video Transcript

[MUSIC PLAYING]

BRAD SMITH: Welcome back to Yahoo Finance Live, everyone. Taking a look at the markets here as we're just about 11 minutes into the start of trading on the day. The Dow, the S&P 500, and the NASDAQ are all in positive territory holding onto gains. Dow up by about 0.5% right now, S&P 500 also up by about the same on a percentage basis. And then additionally, the NASDAQ composite, you're seeing that hold onto gains of 116 points or 1% higher on the day. For more on today's tape let's get to Jared Blikre on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Jared?

JARED BLIKRE: That's right. I was just taking a look at the Y-Fi Interactive, looking at the NASDAQ 100. Now, we talk about or I talk about the NASDAQ composite quite a bit but this is a higher beta engine. And we can see over the last five days up 8.5%, you take a look at what the Dow has done, that is up 3%, well, it's short of 4%. And the S&P 500, the benchmark, up over 5%.

Now, I just want to quickly go to a year-to-date chart so we can see where we are with respect to this rally. Now, we are punching higher just ever so slightly but 4,200 remains the big line in the sand. And that's the level that the market has to get across. Ideally, it punches through, comes back a little bit, and then we head to the next level. That big level is about 4,600. Have to see if that's going to come to fruition.

Now I want to spend a little time on the US dollar index. And we're going to show some longer-term history. This is year-to-date, this is a pretty steep rise for the dollar, the DXY as they call it. It's heavily weighted towards the euro and also the pound. But take a look at the five-year chart here, what stands out is this huge rise. And on a 10-year basis, you can see that we are simply have been trading around in a huge, huge range. And now we are at the upper end of it. But we have come to the upper end of it with significant momentum.

Story continues

So here's a 20-year view, this is going to go back to dot-com era, and in fact, we need to go back to the 1980s to see the next relevant level. And actually, I misspoke, the 1990s, because this level up here, 120 is a huge target, I think we're going to back off a little bit and consolidate. But if we get to that level we need to think about what implications that has not only for risk markets but commodities in general. And we know that commodities have been on the rise here.

Here's a look at the futures market, and we can-- I just wanted to take a quick look at crude oil because that is punching to multi-week highs. We have OPEC+ possibly rolling back some of the restrictions with respect to Russia so we could have more supply coming in. Nevertheless, the price is going up and we need to pay attention to that, guys?

BRIAN SOZZI: Jared, I need your expert chart analysis here. So yesterday Amazon shares one of the top tickers on the Yahoo Finance platform, stock finished up close to 5% in a pressured overall market. I'm looking at Amazon right now, up close to another 4% on good volume in a weakening tape here in the early going. Has a bottom been set in this stock?

JARED BLIKRE: It could be a temporary one. I think we've found a new trading range. We'll go to the chart in a second, I just want to show the market cap view of some of these stocks. Now, Amazon is currently $1.26 trillion, that's the number we have right there, again we're looking at market cap. And here's a chart, this is year-to-date. And you can see, we fell off a cliff in April, just like many other names in the same category but here's a three-year look, this is going to cover all of the pandemic. Amazon had traded in a pretty tight range both to the upside and the downside, had a couple of false breaks here, really suckered in new longs and now we are back to some prior big levels.

Let's take a look at a 10-year view, and you can see indeed back to these big levels. Now, I think we're probably going to bounce around in here for a while, and I wouldn't be surprised if those lows held but nevertheless, I think it's going to be a while before we get back to new highs because 3,000, that is a huge level. And that's not going to exist in the near future because I believe they're doing an eight-to-one stock split pretty soon, something like that.

BRIAN SOZZI: On the mark as always. Jared Blikre, thanks so much.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/market-check-stocks-open-higher-135933526.html,"['AMZN.US', 'DJI.INDX', 'GSPC.INDX', 'GTVMX.US', 'IXIC.INDX', 'QQQ.US', 'SPY.US']",[],"{'polarity': 0.995, 'neg': 0.025, 'neu': 0.881, 'pos': 0.093}"
373,2022-06-01T10:20:10+00:00,Should SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY) Be on Your Investing Radar?,"If you're interested in broad exposure to the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market, look no further than the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 01/29/1993.

The fund is sponsored by State Street Global Advisors. It has amassed assets over $380.01 billion, making it the largest ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.

Why Large Cap Blend

Companies that fall in the large cap category tend to have a market capitalization above $10 billion. They tend to be stable companies with predictable cash flows and are usually less volatile than mid and small cap companies.

Blend ETFs are aptly named, since they tend to hold a mix of growth and value stocks, as well as show characteristics of both kinds of equities.

Costs

When considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts in the long term if all other factors remain equal.

Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.09%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.

It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.41%.

Sector Exposure and Top Holdings

It is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.

This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 27.20% of the portfolio. Healthcare and Financials round out the top three.

Looking at individual holdings, Apple Inc. (AAPL) accounts for about 7.01% of total assets, followed by Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN).

The top 10 holdings account for about 28.33% of total assets under management.

The ETF has a beta of 1 and standard deviation of 23.22% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 507 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.

Alternatives

SPDR S&P 500 ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, SPY is a reasonable option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Blend area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.

The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) and the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) track the same index. While Vanguard S&P 500 ETF has $256.88 billion in assets, iShares Core S&P 500 ETF has $301.13 billion. VOO has an expense ratio of 0.03% and IVV charges 0.03%.

Bottom-Line

While an excellent vehicle for long term investors, passively managed ETFs are a popular choice among institutional and retail investors due to their low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency.

374,2022-06-01T04:00:00+00:00,May Sees ETFs Add $65B Amid Volatility,"During a month that saw some intense market volatility and a near bear market, U.S.-listed ETFs still managed to add $64.5 billion, coming roaring back from a $6.1 billion loss in April.

The industry now has assets under management of $6.67 trillion, which is nonetheless down from the $6.7 trillion managed by U.S.-listed ETFs at the end of the prior month, largely due to market performance.

Year to date, the U.S. ETF industry has added $257 billion, while last year at this time, year-to-date inflows stood at roughly $395 billion.

Taking Risk Off The Table

Investors seem to have been taking a little risk off the table, as fully half of the top 10 ETFs for inflows during the month were in the U.S. fixed income category. That asset class also pulled in more than any other, for a gain of $33.7 billion. For comparison, U.S. equities, usually the asset class dominating flows. gained just $29.1 billion during May.

The iShares National Muni Bond ETF (MUB) added a total of $3.9 billion during the month, claiming the No. 3 spot on the top performers list. The Vanguard Short-Term Bond ETF (BSV) had the second-largest inflows of any fixed income ETF in May, pulling in $3.3 billion, while the SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 Month T-Bill ETF (BIL) and the iShares iBoxx USD High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (HYG) gained $2.7 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively. And the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) added $2.3 billion.

The three S&P 500 ETFs represented the top gainers in May for equities, with the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) gaining more than any other ETF, at $7.5 billion. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) claimed the No. 2 spot, with an addition of $6 billion, while the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) pulled in $3.8 billion.

Also among the top-gaining ETFs for the month, the iShares Core High Dividend ETF (HDV) gained $2.9 billion, and the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Min Vol Factor ETF (EEMV) added $2.3 billion. The presence of those two funds in the top 10 suggests investors are looking for income and diversification at a time when the broad U.S. equity space is flirting with a bear market.

Stepping Away From Sectors

Three sector ETF were among the 10 ETFs that saw the most outflows during the month of May. The Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF) lost more than any other ETF, bleeding $3.9 billion. Meanwhile, the Vanguard Health Care ETF (VHT) and the iShares U.S. Energy ETF (IYE) claimed the Nos. nine and 10 spots, with losses of $903 million and $821 million, respectively.

Interestingly, despite U.S. fixed income seeing strong inflows, the No. 2 fund for outflows in May was the Schwab U.S. TIPS ETF (SCHP), which saw a drain of $2.2 billion. It was followed by the iShares MSCI USA Value Factor ETF (VLUE), which lost $1.9 billion during the month. And even though HDV was one of the top funds for inflows in May, the SPDR S&P Dividend ETF (SDY) saw outflows of $1.9 billion during the same period.

Meanwhile, the SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) and the iShares GSCI Commodity Dynamic Roll Strategy ETF (COMT) came in sixth and seventh for redemptions in May, with losses of $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. With inflation expected to remain high for some time, the move out of two key commodity ETFs suggests investors don’t necessarily see them as the best hedges against it in the current environment.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these investment ideas and the university’s investment philosophy, go directly to Yale University 2022 Portfolio: 4 Best Investment Ideas.

Yale’s endowment fund is managed by its Investments Office, which operates under the supervision of Yale’s Investment Committee. It is the second biggest endowment fund in the world, just behind the Harvard University Endowment Fund. The fund was established more than three centuries ago, in 1718, with an initial sum of £562 provided by Elihu Yale. The total value of the endowment stood at $42.3 billion as of June 30, 2021. It comprises thousands of funds serving different purposes and having distinct restrictions. Nearly 75% of the fund consists of true endowments, which are gifts given by donors to generate long-term funding for specific purposes. Meanwhile, the remaining 25% is quasi-endowment, which means that Yale decides to invest and consider it as an endowment.

In the last two decades, the endowment has yielded an annual return of 11.3% and generated $30.6 billion in relative value. If the time horizon is increased to three decades, then the annual return of the endowment rises to 13.6%.

Investment Philosophy

Yale's Investment Office is focused on generating high inflation-adjusted returns to sustain the present and future requirements of the prestigious university. The team at the Investment Office is focused on forming a suitable risk-adjusted asset allocation. It aims to create strong and long-term partnerships with managers globally that are involved in the improvement of public and private business operations through their insights. In the last three decades, the asset allocation done by the Investment Office at Yale has contributed 1.9% annually, and the selection of high-quality managers has further boosted the outperformance by 2.4% per annum.

The investment team at Yale brings an amalgamation of theoretical knowledge and real-world developments into making their investment portfolio. One of the key theories that the investment team relies on is the mean-variance analysis that was conceptualized by Nobel award receivers Harry Markowitz and James Tobin. Both these individuals have been closely associated with Yale University. Investment management is now considered as much art as science. It requires a keen understanding of qualitative factors before making decisions about an investment portfolio. It must be noted that returns and correlations are difficult to predict. Historical data only provides a guide of what happened in the past but to correctly interpret it and use it in the future, an investment manager should have an understanding of structural changes that are taking place and how to compensate for uncertain times that have never been seen before.

Asset Allocation

In the last three decades, the Investment Committee managing the Yale Endowment fund has significantly shifted the focus of the portfolio from marketable domestic securities to non-traditional asset classes. Back in 1989, 75% of the endowment was invested in US stocks, bonds, and cash. However, as of 2021, this has fallen below the 10% level. Meanwhile, the remaining 90% is invested in absolute return strategies, foreign equity, private equity, and real assets. This is a major reason why the total value of the University's holdings in the 13-F filing is around $530 million only.

The focus to shift on non-traditional asset groups is due to their healthier return potential along with their diversification abilities. Investing in the non-traditional asset group has helped the Yale Endowment fund in building a portfolio with a significantly higher return potential associated with lower risk as compared to its portfolio in the mid-1980s. Investing in alternative assets also provides a chance to exploit the market through active management as these asset classes are not as efficiently priced as the traditional marketable securities. The long-term investment horizon of the Yale Endowment fund provides it an opportunity to take complete benefit of illiquid, less efficient markets like a leveraged buyout, oil and gas, real estate, timber, and venture capital.

The Endowment Fund is known for making unconventional investment decisions as it invested in Google in the 1990s, followed by Airbnb, Inc., Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), and LinkedIn in the early 2000s. As of Q1 2022, Yale University has a stake in iShares MSCI Japan ETF (NYSE:EWJ), Vanguard Emerging Markets Stock Index Fund (NYSE:VWO), and iShares MSCI EAFE ETF (NYSE:EFA). The university has increased its exposure to popular companies such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) through these funds.

378,2022-05-31T14:05:02+00:00,5 Stocks in S&amp;P 500 ETF That Led the Rally Last Week,"The S&P 500 logged in its best week of the year, jumping 6.5% and wiping out its losses in May, thanks to a slew of upbeat earnings results and an encouraging economic data. SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, the proxy version of the S&P 500 Index, has plunged about 12.3%.

While most of the stocks in SPY’s portfolio have risen, we have highlighted five stocks from various corners of the market that have gained in double digits last week. These include Dollar Tree DLTR, DXC Technology Company DXC, Constellation Energy Corporation CEG, AutoZone Inc. AZO and Generac Holdings GNRC. All these stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy), or 3 (Hold).

The gains came basically in the last two days of the week as strong retail earnings and a slowing inflation report lifted investors’ sentiment. Notably, robust earnings from Ulta Beauty ULTA and Gap GPS infused optimism into the retail sector. Meanwhile, an inflation gauge closely tracked by the Federal Reserve rose 6.3% year over year in April, just below a four-decade high set in March and the first slowdown since November 2020.

Further, the Fed minutes rekindled some interest in the stock market as there were no surprises. The minutes showed that the central bank will continue raising interest rates by a half-percentage point each in June and July to combat surging inflation and to avoid an economic downturn (read: Fed Minutes Rekindle Optimism: 5 ETFs That Surged the Most).

JARED BLIKRE: Yes, we're a day later to the market here, a little bit of a down draft. And I want to take a look at the YFi Interactive on a longer term basis. This is going to be the year-to-date chart that we have been tracking. You can see we had a little bit of lift off last week, and we're giving back some of those gains. A little bit too early to tell, but as I'm fond of saying, the first hour of trading on Tuesday makes a big difference towards setting the trend for the week.

And it looks like my YFi Interactive is a little bit unresponsive right now, but nevertheless, I wanted to show you we're up against a very potentially big level. Let's call it an area, $4,150 to $4,200 right in here. A lot of pro traders I'm talking to are watching that to see if the market can exceed that level and maybe use it as support. Now, we did not get that washout that we were looking for. And so that means we might not have the lows in.

And in fact, I think we could get back up to those record highs, but I don't see us materially advancing beyond that. I think this is going to be a market that frustrates both the bears and the bulls. And let's see if we can get a check of the 10-year T-note yield. That is up 10 basis points. That is a pretty big move, so some more volatility in the bond market. But I want you to check out the Bank of America MOVE index. This is like the VIX for the, excuse me, for the bond market, and it is trending down.

This is also a year-to-date look. The latest figures are as of the close Friday. But nevertheless, that is important to see in the market here. Now, let's take a look. This is going to be, I think, a lot of red here. Energy was in the green early, and it is still the only thing in the green. Now, It is up 1 1/2%. We're going to talk about commodities in just a minute. Health care, utilities, and industrials, all of those are down more than 1 1/2%. So is staples, by the way, so that is a bit of a defensive move right there.

Story continues

Let's check in on the meme stocks. I saw a couple of these guys flying high, AMC up 3%. Top Gun a nice catalyst perhaps for that, maybe actually trading on fundamentals here. And then finally, let's check out something in the green. So that was energy. That's in the green. Also, you guys were talking about the China Golden Dragon index. That was up 4% on the open. So we're seeing some movement here, too, guys.

- Yeah, appreciate the reminder, Jared. I have to go back and crunch the numbers on the Hindenburg omen. You know, I haven't done it in about a month and a half. But I know you're also hammering home the move in lumber prices.

JARED BLIKRE: Yeah, so let's go back to the YFi Interactive. We've had some really big moves over the last month. So I'm going to put a one-month view, and you can see to the downside, lumber is in last place. That's LBS equals F. That's down 32%. We do have some big movers. We'll take a look at those in a second, but here is the year-to-date view. And in fact, let's go back three years so we can see what happened since the beginning of the pandemic.

And [? Sasi, ?] this is no bulging bicep. This is a huge, huge M top that we're looking at right here, and it looks like we may want to test the bottom in at $450. But this was a 50% sell off here. This was about 75% to 80%. This is more than 50%, so just a lot of volatility. We've seen weakness in the housing market. Mortgage rates are finally coming back down a little bit. But on the flip side, just want to highlight we are seeing a surge in other commodity prices.

RBOB gasoline futures, that's up 20%. Then we have natural gas. Crude oil at the highest price in a couple of weeks here, so we are definitely seeing some signs of life in commodities. It's simply a bifurcated world here. And finally, here's a three-year chart of soybeans. Beans in the teens, are they going to break into the 20s? Could happen, guys.

- Jared, you call it M top. I call it the Swiss Alps indicator. Looks like mountains to me. Jared Blikre, we'll talk to you later.

JAREDBLIKRE: Been there. I love it.

380,2022-05-27T19:41:07+00:00,Join the Wall Street's Rebound Rally With These ETFs,"Wall Street looks set to end the losing streak this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average Index, which saw its first eight-week losing streak since 1923 in the week ending May 20, has been up 4.4% so far this week. The other two broad-market indices, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite, which witnessed their seven-week lean patch last week, have also gained 4% and 3.4% each so far this week.

Part of this rally can be attributed to investors lobbying to witness a peak in the inflation levels. Moreover, the recently released Fed minutes from the May 3-4 meeting buoyed some optimism among the market participants as there was no element of surprise. The minutes highlighted that the central bank officials are ready to move ahead with several 50-basis point interest rate hikes to control the red-hot inflation readings.

Quincy Krosby, chief equity strategist for LPL Financial, believes that the U.S. consumer spending is relatively strong. In this regard, she mentioned that “To be sure, the data releases this week suggest the economy is slowing, and the Fed appears poised to raise rates at a 50 basic point clip over the next two months. But the notion that the consumer, 70 percent of the U.S. economy, is on a spending strike, is overblown as earnings reports coupled with positive guidance indicate otherwise”, as stated in a CNBC article.

Several retail earnings also rekindled bullishness among investors. Macy’s M shares were up 19.3% on May 26 on the lifted guidance for 2022 profit levels. Dollar Tree DLTR also rose 21.9% on an earnings beat.

Adding to the upbeat scenario is the decline in the initial jobless claims for the week ended May 21. The same came in at 210,000, declining from the previous week’s reading of 218,000, per a CNBC article.

Also, certain U.S. economic data releases have been encouraging so far. The Department of Commerce reported that retail sales in April were up 0.9% month over month, below the consensus estimate of 1%. Year over year, retail sales grew 8.2% in April. The Federal Reserve reported that industrial production increased 1.1% last month, well above the consensus estimate of 0.5%.

381,2022-05-26T16:35:46+00:00,Strong airline forecasts defy fears of an economic slowdown,"The major airlines aren't sounding the alarm on the economy yet.

On Thursday, both Southwest Airlines (LUV) and JetBlue (JBLU) raised their quarterly guidance, citing strong demand heading into the critical summer travel season. Both upward revisions came just weeks after the companies initially reported their forecasts last month.

""JetBlue’s operational performance has improved steadily since early April,"" the company said in a filing Thursday. ""The demand environment continues to be strong, with bookings exceeding Company expectations.""

JetBlue added that sales for June are ""shaping up to be meaningfully better compared to earlier months in the quarter."" For the second quarter ending on June 30, revenue will now likely be at or above the high-end of previous guidance for a between 11% and 16% increase compared to 2019, JetBlue said. And available seat miles (ASM), a closely watched metric for airlines, will likely grow between 2% and 3% over 2019 levels, versus prior guidance for flat to up 3%.

The optimistic forecast stands in stark contrast to the far less rosy outlooks issued by companies outside of the travel industry.

Dismal guidance from retailers including Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT) and Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) painted the picture of an economy softening much more rapidly than many had anticipated in the face of inflation. The pessimism translated to a broader market slide last week, which was extended even further after social media company Snap (SNAP) slashed its own guidance earlier this week amid a macroeconomic environment it said had ""deteriorated further and faster than anticipated."" Airline stocks are soaring, with Southwest and JetBlue saying revenue this summer will be even stronger than they were expecting. The airlines made their comments Thursday, May 26, 2022, in regulatory filings. (AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee)

But the airlines suggest there have been pockets of strength even in the midst of these concerns, as consumers appear willing to spend on travel that hadn't been accessible at the height of the pandemic. Southwest on Thursday also raised its guidance, and now expects operating revenue to grow between 12% and 15% for the fiscal second quarter compared to 2019. It previously saw a rise of between 8% and 12%.

Story continues

""The Company continues to experience strong load factors and an acceleration in bookings for summer travel,"" the airline said in a Thursday filing.

These latest forecasts from Southwest and JetBlue built on upbeat outlooks issued by other travel companies in recent weeks, which have all pointed to persistent pent-up demand for travel ahead of the summer.

United Airlines (UAL) earlier this month updated its guidance, saying that ""the demand environment has continued to improve."" Marriott's (MAR) CEO Anthony Capuano also told Yahoo Finance that he expected a ""blockbuster summer,"" while Airbnb (ABNB) told investors it was already ""seeing substantial demand for summer travel"" in early May.

Importantly, each of these outlooks have underscored the strength of demand, even as supply-side concerns like rising energy prices remain.

""The improvement in the Company's second quarter 2022 operating revenue guidance is primarily attributable to continued passenger yield strength, which has more than offset the increase in its second quarter 2022 fuel price projection,"" Southwest said in its filing.

And the details of even the retailers' grim guidance has also shown much more resilience in demand relative to supply. Walmart, Target and Abercrombie & Fitch each exceeded estimates for first-quarter revenue while cutting full-year earnings forecasts, given expectations that they would have to absorb rising transportation, labor, and other input costs, and potentially slash prices on products they'd stockpiled over the past year.

Peer retailer Macy's (M) summed it up succinctly in its earnings report Thursday morning.

""While macroeconomic pressures on consumer spending increased during the quarter, our customers continued to shop,"" the company said.

Reddit unexpectedly became one of the most talked-about platforms in the investing world. Its forum, called WallStreetBets, was at the center of the retail trading frenzy which took the stock market by storm early last year. Though its impact has cooled off considerably, the power of social media cannot be denied.

Reddit is a social media platform that allows users to comment and share links on multiple topics of interest. Investors can rally around a community to induce a short squeeze, and more importantly for investors.

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been an investor darling, generating over a 600% total return in the past decade. The tech giant operates a resilient business that has stood the test of time.

Its sales have increased by a tremendous 12.9% compound annual growth rate, led by its flagship iPhone. The smartphone is in its 13th generation and is in the pockets of close to 1 billion people globally.

Over the years, it has diversified its income stream by aggressively expanding its services business. It includes a suite of services that have grown immensely in popularity. Apple services boast over 800 million paid subscribers, with 165 million new subscribers in 2021 alone.

Revenues from the segment constitute roughly 20% of the company’s total sales. Moreover, the company’s incredible cash flow generation is second to none, having produced $105.8 billion in free cash flows in the past year. Its robust cash positioning allows it to consistently rewards its shareholders through buybacks and dividend.

Disney (NYSE:DIS) has earned the right to be called the uncontested ruler of content. It dominates the theme-park business and the box office, effectively making it a juggernaut in the entertainment space.

While its theme park business is recovering from the pandemic’s effects, its box office results have come to the rescue while streaming is now rocking the ship. Since its launch, Disney+ has been a smash-hit and now boasts 137.7 million subscribers at the end of the second quarter.

This represents a colossal increase of 32.9% over 103.6 million subscribers it reported in the previous year. Its other streaming services, including ESPN+ and Hulu, have also been growing their subscriber base, albeit at a slower pace.

Moreover, with the pandemic restrictions lifted across the globe and travel demand picking up, its theme-park business will be back, making the big bucks.

Best Reddit Stocks: AMC Entertainment (AMC) AMC theater in Manhattan, New York City. AMC stock.

AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) took a hammering during the pandemic, with its movie theaters shut down due to the global pandemic.

Consequently, it piled up tons of debt to stay afloat, which raised bankruptcy concerns at one time. However, AMC is looking in a significantly better position with the blow-out box office performances of recently released films.

The first-quarter revenue growth came in at a spectacular 430% from the prior-year period to $785.7 million. Attendance rates are increasing at an encouraging pace each month, and a strong film slate ahead points to a promising future.

Cash burn remains a problem, though, which will weigh down the company’s long-term profitability. Nevertheless, if it can continue to rack up quarters such as the first, it will be better positioned to pay down its colossal debt balance and progress towards expansion.

Microsoft (MSFT) The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.

Shares of tech behemoth Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) have dipped considerably as part of the broad-based sell-off in the tech industry.

MSFT stock’s performance has had little impact on the underlying business, which continues firing on all cylinders. Its recently released third-quarter results showed an 18% bump in revenue growth to $49.4 billion. It enjoyed massive growth across multiple business segments, with its cloud unit taking the crown.

Microsoft’s intelligent cloud generated a handsome $19.1 billion in sales, up 26% from the prior-year period. Cloud services increased a spectacular 46% compared to the 5% increase in server product sales. CEO Satya Nadella states that deals worth over $100 million for Azure have increased by over 50% yearly.

7 Large-Cap Stocks to Buy Right Now

Additionally, the company’s levered free cash flow growth is over 29%, around 6% higher than its 5-year average. Hence, with MSFT stock trading 30% lower than recent highs, it’s best to load up on it at current levels.

SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY) is a pioneer of the exchange-traded fund concept dating back almost three decades ago. It is the oldest and largest ETF in terms of asset size. It invests in companies weighted by market cap according to the S&P 500.

Naturally, the tech-heavy ETF is suffering in the current downturn. The S&P 500 is dominated by tech-related growth stocks, which carry a significant amount of risk.

Nevertheless, the index has returned over 250% of total returns to its investors in the past decade. Hence, despite the bear runs, we have seen the fund persevere over the long term. Therefore, SPY stock remains an excellent long-term play.

Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been a stand-out performer in its industry for the past several years. Its whopping sales growth has been fueled by technological trends, including 5G communication, AI, data centers, self-driving cars, gaming, and others.

These market verticals contributed to a gigantic increase in sales from $4.3 billion in 2013 to $26.9 billion last year. Nvidia’s diversified portfolio of products and stronghold in various markets is highly advantageous to command further valuation upsides.

Its fundamental strength is incredible, generating double-digit percentage growth across its top and bottom lines for the past several years. Cash flows have consistently grown at over 50%, building its enormous cash war chest of $21.2 billion.

386,2022-05-20T19:45:00+00:00,How ETF Assets React To Bear Markets,"The S&P 500 briefly dropped 20% off its recent peak on Friday, marking a bear market after what’s been a grisly and volatile 2022 for stocks. But a look at the short history of ETFs in bear markets produces a mixed picture of what that will mean for the asset base underpinning the industry.

ETF.com analyzed historical assets under management data from FactSet to see how ETF assets reacted to bear markets since the inception of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) in January 1993.

September 2000: The Dot-Com Bubble

The first peak-to-trough drop of more than 20% since the first U.S.-listed ETF carries a close similarity to 2022’s bear market: A run of high-flying technology stocks abruptly ended after the Federal Reserve began hiking interest rates.

The dot-com bubble saw the S&P 500 drop from 1527 points in late March 2020 to 776 points in September 2002, a 49% fall.

U.S.-listed ETFs added approximately $68.9 billion in assets during the period where broad index funds made up the ETF market. Just 36 ETFs were trading at the beginning of the bubble, made up mostly of State Street’s sector ETF suite and iShares’ foreign equity funds.

Of that group, 15 had a net gain in assets during the bear market. SPY dominated flows in the fledgling asset class with just shy of $23 billion in inflows, followed by the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) adding $6.6 billion. Unsurprisingly, the biggest loser among ETFs in that period was the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK), with a loss of $574.5 million in assets.

A total of 72 ETFs would launch during the bear market, as BlackRock Inc. and State Street Corp. expanded their index offerings. Vanguard Group Inc. also made its debut, with two ETFs, most notably the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI).

October 2007: The Great Financial Crisis

The burst of the subprime loan-backed U.S. housing bubble and its knock-on effects through the financial sector generated a nearly 57% loss in the S&P 500 Index between Oct. 9, 2007 and March 9, 2009.

Story continues

The industry would lose $142 billion in assets among funds that were trading at the beginning of the crisis to when the bear market ended. The  iShares MSCI EAFE ETF (EFA) took the largest asset loss during the period, with a $28.3 billion outflow, followed by SPY’s $25.8 billion loss.

Only three funds managed to add more than $5 billion in the crisis, with the SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) adding $17.2 billion, the iShares TIPS Bond ETF (TIP) adding $5.8 billion and the iShares iBoxx USD Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (LQD) adding $5.4 billion.

A total of 640 ETFs would debut during this bear market.

February 2020: The COVID-19 Crash

The shortest S&P 500 bear market on record came as the U.S. and other major economies seized as COVID-19 forced large-scale shutdowns of in-person activity.

Investors pulled $1.2 trillion in assets under management from Feb. 19, 2020 to March 23, 2020, amounting to a 28% drawdown.

However, central banks cut their interest rates to near zero and took trillions of dollars’ worth of assets onto their balance sheets to keep economies stimulated, leading to a bull market from the second quarter of 2020 into the end of 2021.

The resulting market euphoria more than doubled the size of the industry. U.S.-listed ETFs held $3.7 trillion in assets at the end of March 2020 and would end 2021 with $7.2 trillion under management.

The market decline has hurt almost every stock asset class, but the tech sector, as represented by the Invesco QQQ TrustETF (NASDAQ:QQQ), has gone down more than the broader market. It is down about 27% year to date. The SPDR Dow-Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSE:DIA) is down about 13%; the SPDR S&P 500 Index ETF (NYSE:SPY), down about 15%; and the SPDR S&P 400 Index ETF (NYSE:MDY) down more than 14%. So when looking for bargains after the tumble, don’t ignore oversold tech stocks.

Part of the reason why oversold tech stocks might rebound is thanks to the expected growth in the sector. Some of these tech stocks went down more than other sectors because tech outperformed on the way up. Some of them had profits that were outsized, and investors could sell them and book the profit — perhaps even use those profits to offset losses in other stocks.

Oversold tech stocks could have valuations that are attractive enough to buy now or could be stocks to note now and to consider buying on future weakness.

Applied Materials (AMAT)

A major company in the technology space that is down over 30% from its 52-week high and is expected to grow earnings is Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT). AMAT serves the semiconductor industry by providing manufacturing equipment and services to companies that manufacture semiconductor, integrated circuits and other products. AMAT is global, servicing and selling to consumers and the semiconductor industry in the U.S., China, and throughout Asia and Europe.

Applied Materials’ earnings are expected to increase in the next couple years. Yahoo! Finance shows the average EPS  expected for 2022 is $8.10, 18% higher than 2021’s mark of $6.84. The target for 023 is even higher, at $9.30.

Simplywallst.com calculates that AMAT’s market price is 44.2% under its fair market value for the company. It also opines that among the headwinds for AMAT is that the company has a large exposure to China, and China is experiencing a slowdown.

AMAT might be an oversold tech stock, but the stock on a valuation basis is not cheap and investors could wait for a further market pullback or dollar cost average into the stock.

Another oversold tech stock, down over 70% from its 52-week high, is PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL). PYPL does have some attractive fundamentals: the company services traders and consumers with payment solutions, mostly on the internet. PYPL has about 426 million active accounts in late 2021, according to Morningstar.com.

Earnings might be hard to maintain or improve, and that surely helped lead to it becoming an oversold tech stock. PYPL will report earnings in July. TipRanks.com reports its consensus earnings forecast for the second quarter 2022 is 89 cents per share versus last year’s earnings of $1.15 per share for that quarter. TipRanks has a strong buy consensus recommendation.

Zacks Investment Research has a different view, recommending a “strong sell” on PYPL, and estimating that PYPL will earn $3.96 a share in the current year, versus its prior year earnings of $4.60 a share.

So, there is risk in PYPL. But if an investor understands this, and is patient, PYPL could be an oversold tech stock that will pay off.

The memory-chip industry is very volatile, and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) has dropped close to 30% from its 52-week high, which makes it an oversold tech stock. The company makes DRAM chips, which function as the main memory in servers, PCs, and other electronic products. MU also make NAND chips, which serve data storage needs.

Investors Business Daily reported on May 5 that TrendForce, a research firm, found that most DRAM factories experienced lower shipments in the 2021 fourth quarter. The drop was caused by lower demand because of pandemic-related supply issues. On May 10, TrendForce reported that the supply of NAND would be greater than demand in the second half of 2022.

This seems to have spooked investors away from the chip sector. And the general market drop, caused by real problems, exacerbated the semiconductor stocks’ decline.

But MU says that its next-generation chips make it the leader for the next several quarters. And in September 2021 Micron Chief Executive Sanjay Mehrotra said that “we established technology leadership concurrently in both DRAM and Nand.” That makes MU an excellent oversold tech stock to buy here.

Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) has lost about 25% from its 52-week high so far. This company develops electronic products and software applications and produces electronic design automation around the globe. Synopsis also produces application security testing tools and offers services for these tools.

SNPS earnings are impressive. Last year the company made $6.83 per share; this year, MarketWatch.com reports that analysts estimate that SNPS will earn $7.91 per share, and in 2023 they expect $9.20. The average target price from analysts is $388.33.

Zacks Research calculates SNPS earnings per share growth rate at 16.21% for the next thee to five years, with a forward P/E at 34.51. Its PEG Ratio is 2.13, which is not cheap. But this oversold tech stock can be bought here for appreciation, knowing that there is more risk in higher multiple stocks.

ANSYS (NASDAQ:ANSS) currently sits about 40% lower than its 52-week high. Ansys is a company that produces software that helps its global clients create engineering simulations. The company has developed its Pervasive Engineering Simulation to solve design problems for its customers.

The company is growing. On May 4, ANSS announced that it acquired Motor Design Limited, and that this acquisition will increase the number of its available design offerings.

Also, it will enable the customers of Ansys to design and produce more efficient electric machines.

The valuation for ANSS is high, and in this market environment investors might wait for lower prices. Zacks Investment Research reports consensus current year estimated earnings per share of $7.85; last year the company made $7.37 a share. With a forward P/E ratio of 30.88, and a PEG ratio of 2.68, the market price of ANSS is too high. However, on a price pullback ANSS could be a stock to buy.

Morningstar.com reports that the forward P/E multiple on NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) is 12.82, and that the PEG ratio on these earnings is 1.22, which is a reasonable valuation and attractive enough to make it a stock to buy. If the market declines more, the stock could drop also.

A dollar-cost-average buying strategy could be used with NXPI stock, since it has already dropped about 27% from its 52-week high, making it an oversold tech stock.

On May 3, Brian Colello of Morningstar wrote that NXPI had good first-quarter 2022 results and a good second-quarter forecast, and that chip demand continues to be strong, exceeding demand. Morningstar has a $240 fair value estimate on the stock and considers the shares “fundamentally undervalued.”

The last of our oversold tech stocks — a company that lost about 52% of its market value in the last 52 weeks — is Datadog (NASDAQ:DDOG). In a write-up by Malik Ahmed Kahn, analyst at Morningstar, on May 5, he reiterated his $192 fair value estimate of the company. Kahn’s opinion was that the stock was down with general market selling and that DDOG was at a good price for exposure to SaaS companies.

Morningstar.com shows a forward price/earnings ratio of 164 times earnings, and a PEG ratio of 2.87. These valuations are high, especially in the market environment we find ourselves in.

But this oversold tech stock is in a growth industry with good services, such as security monitoring of customers’ technology stack.

TipRanks.com expects DDOG to report its second-quarter 2022 consensus earnings in August. The consensus is for 15 cents against last year’s same period earnings of 9 cents. Those are impressive earnings, and DDOG should be watched for a buy point.

Short interest in the $352 billion SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ticker SPY) as a percentage of shares outstanding is above 7%, close to the highest since March 2020, IHS Markit Ltd. data show. Meanwhile, bets against the $19.5 billion iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond exchange-traded fund (TLT) have shrunk to just 3.5%, the lowest since September 2020.

The dynamic highlights the building anxiety over the US economy as price pressures boil over. Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said Tuesday that “growth has to move down” for inflation to cool, and as a result, there “could be some pain involved” in restoring price stability. While that environment would likely benefit long-dated Treasuries, equities would struggle, according to Peter Tchir of Academy Securities.

“We are starting to shift from ‘inflation’ fears to ‘recession’ fears, so I think that positioning is consistent with a ‘recession’ outlook,” said Tchir, the firm’s head of macro strategy. “I think ‘recession’ is premature, but it’s something I’m seeing more people talk about and put on trades to reflect.”

SPY has dropped 18% so far this year, with the S&P 500 close to bear-market territory. The hottest inflation readings in four decades has TLT lower by more than 20% in 2022, though a bid has returned to bonds over the past week amid the market turmoil.

More than $32 billion has been pulled from SPY alone this year, putting the world’s largest ETF on track for the worst year of outflows ever. On the other side of the trade, more than $49 billion has flooded into fixed-income funds even though roughly 96% of bond ETFs have posted year-to-date losses.

Shares of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY) look to have finally found a floor after falling over 18% from the all-time highs over $475 in early January. That means SPY stock might be a bargain here. According to the latest figures from Yardeni Research, revenues for the S&P 500 have grown over 15% on a yearly basis, with operating earnings surging to an even more impressive rise of just under 27%.

The combination of lower prices (P) and better earnings (E) means that the P/E ratio for SPY stock has dropped considerably and is now under 20. Lower multiples make stocks attractive on a fundamental basis.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

The forward P/E, based on expected earnings in 12 months, is now below 18 for the first time since the second quarter of 2020, according to FactSet.

The 7 Best Long-Term Stocks to Buy Now

Certainly a big drop from the forward P/E over 21 to start the year.

Valuation multiples should have come down somewhat given the recent rise in yields, but it seems likely they overshot. Now that the 10-year has fallen back below 3%, multiples may start to to expand slightly. This will provide a tailwind for stocks over the next few months.

InvestorPlace contributor Chris Tyler recently penned an insightful piece on why he likes the SPY at current levels. He noted both the price action and Federal Reserve action as reasons to be bullish. Chris also mentioned that he preferred the deeper value area near $345-$375 as an entry point. More on that later.

Technical Take

SPY stock had reached very oversold readings before strengthening. Its 9-day RSI dipped below 30, but has since recovered. Bollinger Percent B was in negative territory before going positive. MACD  reached levels of extreme pessimism but have turned sharply higher. The SPY was also trading at a big discount to the 20-day moving average.

Previous times all these indicators aligned in a similar fashion marked significant short-term lows in SPY stock. Look for history to repeat itself once again. This is especially true since the bounce occurred at the major long-term support level of $385.

Volatility View

The Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, is 30-day measure of implied volatility (IV) in the S&P 500. VIX is by far the most widely followed measure of IV in the options market. It is also known as the fear gauge, since it tends to spike when stocks drop sharply.

The VIX once again spiked to recent highs near the 35 area when stocks made their lows last Thursday. It means that option prices, especially for protective puts, had gotten very expensive. Prior times VIX neared these lofty levels proved to be profitable times to buy stocks. This contrarian VIX-based buy signal has a solid track record over the years.

So to position to be a buyer of SPY on further weakness, a defined-risk out-of-the money bull put spread makes probabilistic sense. The recent rise in VIX means we can get a bigger discount for the same price by selling put spreads. In essence, much more margin for safety for the same bang for your buck as before.

How To Trade SPY Now

Sell the July $360/$355 put spread for a 60-cent net credit.

Maximum gain on the trade is $60 per spread. Maximum risk is $440 per spread. Potential return on risk is 13.63%. The short $360 put strike provides a 10% downside cushion to the $400.09 closing price for SPY stock.

The $360 short strike also lines up with the aforementioned deeper value area between $345 and $375 ($360 average) that Chris Tyler mentioned in his article. It is definitely an opportune time to get paid for your patience by selling an out-of-the money put spread on an oversold and underloved SPY stock.

Video Transcript

BRAD SMITH: April retail sales coming in this morning, shy of estimates, though. Analysts continuing to watch for how COVID-19 is rippling through the economy and affecting consumer mobility, changing how likely consumers are to spend on everything from dining out to air travel. Let's take a deeper look at some of those newly released retail sales numbers. Joining us now, we've got Beth Ann Bovino, who's the S&P Global Chief US economist. Beth Ann, great to have you here with us today.

And particularly here, as we kind of evaluate these retail sales figures, it's also important to discuss the shift, perhaps, in spending from some goods and into services as well right now. And how would you pair that with the data that we've seen come through this morning?

BETH ANN BOVINO: Well, the numbers that came in, I mean, the retail sales numbers, it was pretty much broad-based, which was kind of nice to see. Yeah, it was a little bit under expectations, but not by much. I do want to note that we did see a nice reading for core spending, so that was also strong. In terms of the shift away from goods, basically, goods, to services, that kind of makes sense because what we're seeing is a reopening of the US economy, even though Omicron or the new variant has certainly has caused some concern.

People seem to be going about their business. When we look at our real-time data, what we've seen is that both OpenTable, tables, basically, in-room dining, people going to restaurants, is very close to where it was pre-pandemic. You're seeing people going out to hotels and going out on vacations. So in that sense, you're seeing a lot of that activity, something that's been pent-up demand for some time. And the need to purchase new products, well, we bought a lot of TVs and appliances, et cetera, so you can see that demand is also winding down.

JULIE HYMAN: Hey, Beth Ann, it's Julie here. Between these numbers, the retail sales numbers, which showed a little bit of a drop in grocery store sales, for example, and Walmart, which, of course, I know is a specific company, but I think we can take a macro read based on Walmart, given its size, what does that tell you about how folks, for example, at the lower end of the income spectrum are doing right now, particularly in response to inflation?

BETH ANN BOVINO: Well, one of the concerns that we've been talking about for some time is, yes, we did see a really nice reading in terms of retail sales in nominal terms or in current dollars. But what we have seen is if we adjust this, which we have done at S&P Global, if we adjust this for inflation, what you end up seeing is almost a wedge between real and nominal, meaning that people are spending a lot of cash, but buying much fewer items. In fact, if we measure it in real terms, people are buying about the same amount in terms of items as they bought just going back to July of last year. That's a real struggle.

When you talk about affordability issue, which people are hurt the most, lower income households. If we want to-- and that's something that we are also starting to see some signs of a squeeze. While I don't know what the Walmart numbers actually are saying, one of the concerns, of course, that is an area where lower income households-- a place where lower income households spend a good chunk of their cash. Is that slowing down as well? That would be one concern I have.

BRIAN SOZZI: Given that multitude of concerns, Beth Ann, do you think we're watching a recession starting to take form?

BETH ANN BOVINO: We think that right now, US households-- and this is also for lower income households-- right now, people are still sitting on a nice bit of savings. And the reason why is because we spent so many months in quarantine. Many people didn't spend and go out and spend. So even on-- even low income households have a little bit of a cushion. Higher income households have a much more, although that's being hit by certainly the stock market disarray at this point in time.

With that said, that gives us some cushion this year, but eventually, people are going to close their pocketbooks. That doesn't bode well for the US economy going forward. We do expect, while we don't necessarily have a recession in our forecast, we do see the risk of a recession increasing. We now have it at about 30%. We see the risk, though, much larger in 2023, when those cumulative rate hikes from the Fed to attack inflation starts to weigh on mortgage payments and monthly payments for people, going forward.

BRAD SMITH: And so amid pricing pressure, the Fed has also prioritized price stability, given some of the abnormally high prices, as they put it previously. When might we see some of that price stability come a reality? And what measures need to be implemented in order for that to be true and come to fruition?

BETH ANN BOVINO: Well, when we're looking at the most recent inflation data, CPI and producer pricing index numbers that came out, we did see a little bit of a moderation on a year over year basis. That's great to know. But it's still very close to its 40-year high, so-- both of them. So-- in particularly, CPI.

So again, that means that the Fed has their work cut out for them. The Fed responds by raising rates very aggressively. And we expect the Fed-- the 50 point basis hike that we saw most recently, that's not just-- that's not a one-off. We expect several more this year while there-- and there has been talk, although it's been pushed back by Chair Powell, of a 75 basis point hike.

There has been talk by some members that might be something that's needed later on. And we certainly wouldn't rule that out. The impact from Fed policy on inflation and also on economic activity usually works with a lag so that the rate hikes that we're seeing now, expect to see an impact on GDP, as well as inflation, probably six months down the road down the road. That's why I'd say with these cumulative rate hikes this year, the feeling will be more-- will likely be felt in 2023.

JULIE HYMAN: Beth Ann, this is something I continue to struggle with, because if the Fed is operating-- I think most economists would say the Fed should have acted earlier, but obviously, it didn't. So considering that lag that we're talking about, wouldn't it make sense if the Fed stopped earlier than most folks say they should if, indeed, the effect is going to be felt when the economy is starting to dramatically slow already?

BETH ANN BOVINO: Well, I think that the Fed is working, reading this, reading the economic indicators by Braille. It's hard to really get a sense of what Fed policy will do, how fast they go, how much it's needed. If they go too slow, as you had indicated, if they put them out-- put a few out now and wait a little bit, inflation expectations, which is a big concern for the Fed, may not really address, may not necessarily think that the Fed is moving fast enough. If inflation expectations go out of-- de-anchor, as you will, then the Fed would have to move even faster in raising rates next year.

So I think the Fed's throwing the bazooka out there for 2022 on the concern that if they don't get ahead of it right now, there's going to be more inflation down the road. So, indeed, there was a question of an overshoot. And I do expect that they will overshoot. But the concern is if they go too slow, given they were too slow last year, inflation could go-- could unwind and cause more problems next year.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/economist-recession-risk-increasing-especially-143007966.html,"['DJI.INDX', 'FVX.INDX', 'GSPC.INDX', 'IXIC.INDX', 'QQQ.US', 'SPY.US', 'TNX.INDX', 'TYX.INDX']",[],"{'polarity': -0.56, 'neg': 0.054, 'neu': 0.893, 'pos': 0.053}"

Recent market troubles provide investors the opportunity to snap up oversold dividend stocks. The double whammy of macroeconomic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions has made the equity market volatile since the start of the year.

Several growth stocks are in the doldrums as the uncertain backdrop has driven investors away from risky bets.

Defensive stocks haven’t fared any better either. A case in point is the biopharma sector. The iShares Biotechnology ETF (NASDAQ: IBB) has shed about 22%, worse than the nearly 13% drop by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY).

Bonds, which are supposedly less risky because they generate steady returns, haven’t fared well.

The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note has been hovering above 3% ever since the Federal Open Market Committee increased rates by 50 basis points.  This points to lackluster demand for bonds even as investors swerve away from risky bets.

Against this backdrop, these oversold dividend stocks can be safe havens that can provide regular cash flow for investors. Investment in quality dividend stocks will add stability.

Cross-border money transfer and payment services company Western Union (NYSE:WU) is locked in a lackluster trading range of $17-$20, after having pulled back from the pre-Covid highs of a tad below $28.50.

Story continues

The company’s fundamentals have been on slippery grounds. Revenue for the first quarter fell 4%, dragged by slowing retail money transfer and the suspension of services in Russia and Belarus.

The Western Union team under the new chief executive officer Devin McGranahan has begun an enterprise-wide strategy review process. The review process has thrown up two focus areas, namely retail business acceleration and digital and omnichannel customer growth.

Fundamental improvement could come slowly and steadily as geopolitical and macro overhangs clear up.

One pulling point is the company’s commitment toward shareholder returns.

Western Union has consistently paid dividends since it was spun off from First Data and began trading as a public company in 2006.

The company found ways to continue to pay out even amid the pandemic and Russia’s invasion of  Ukraine which dented its top-line performance.

The company’s annual dividend works out to $0.94, translating to a dividend yield of 5.5%. The payout ratio is 41.37% and the annualized growth over the last five years is 7.34%.

Vornado Realty (NYSE:VNO) operates both office and retail properties, with office accounting for about 80% of its business.

Founded in 1982, the company stuttered through the pandemic but has been showing green shoots of recovery.

In the March quarter, the company’s adjusted funds from operations (FFO) improved to $0.79 per share, up from $0.65 per share a year ago. Top line grew 16.4% year-over-year.

Vornado was forced to cut back on its dividend in the aftermath of the pandemic. With the current payout of $0.53 per share, the dividend yield is around 6.2%.

Given the recent improvement in its operating performance, the company could nudge up, or at least maintain the current dividend rate.

After failing to hold support around $40, the stock has pulled back sharply since April. The 14-day relative strength index (RSI) is around 31, confirming the oversold nature of the stock.

Asset management firm Blackstone (NYSE:BX) recently paid out its quarterly dividend at $1.32 per share, about a 5.3% yield.

The company’s first-quarter results showed $915.5 billion in assets under management (AUM), a 41% year-over-year increase. It had $49.9 billion in inflows during the quarter.

Blackstone invests in diverse alternative asset classes on behalf of institutional investors. This diversification functions as a portfolio hedge for Blackstone.

The RSI of the stock is skewed more toward the oversold zone, signaling it is now available for a bargain buy.

398,2022-05-16T11:20:47+00:00,"Stock market news live updates: Stock futures, oil prices decline after China data disappoints","U.S. stock futures traded lower on Monday, with equities resuming a downward slide as concerns over the growth outlook persisted amid elevated inflation.

Contracts on the S&P 500 declined by about 0.3% ahead of the opening bell. Nasdaq futures dropped 0.5%, as mega-cap technology companies including Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) each headed for lower opens. Contracts on the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded little changed to slightly lower.

U.S. crude oil prices (CL=F) declined for the first time in four sessions after new economic data from China came in weaker-than-expected, as the latest wave of virus-related restrictions in the country curbed mobility. China's retail sales dropped by 11.1% in April over last year, marking the worst decline since March 2020, while industrial production unexpectedly dropped by 2.9% compared to the same month last year.

The move lower in risk assets on Monday extended a recent stretch of volatility across markets. Stocks closed out last week with a sixth consecutive weekly loss, bringing the S&P 500 a total of 16.1% below its record high from Jan. 3. This has come, in turn, as investors weighed the risks of a deeper economic downturn as the Federal Reserve looks to curb inflation running near its hottest level in four decades, geopolitical turmoil continues in Ukraine, and China grapples with its largest COVID outbreak since 2020.

And amid these concerns, Wall Street analysts have struck a more cautious tone on stocks. Goldman Sachs slashed its year-end price target on the S&P 500 to 4,300 from 4,700 in a new note. The lowered target reflects ""higher interest rates and slower economic growth than we previously assumed,"" according to David Kostin, Goldman Sachs chief U.S. equity strategist. And in a recession scenario, Kostin added, the S&P 500 would likely fall even further to 3,600.

Other strategists also underscored the plethora of current risks to equities, and cautioned against reading too deeply into one-day bounces.

""We think the turning point is really an open question at this juncture. We're probably between what we would call two repricings: Repricing one is the Federal Reserve-induced repricing,"" Eric Freedman, U.S. Bank Asset Management chief investment officer, told Yahoo Finance Live. ""When the Fed says they're going to raise rates, every other asset class has to move down in price and up in yield. So we're really in the middle of that. There could be a turning point there, depending on what the Fed decides to do in terms of communications.""

""But the next repricing — again, the risk of potential more downside — is if we start to see higher commodity costs as well as higher borrowing costs structurally trickle into the real economy and stay there for some time,"" he added. ""So do think that we're in a deeply oversold condition ... but we would still be a bit on the cautious side right now thinking that there's more potential downside ahead.""

The SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY) was due for a bounce at some point. Going on six straight weekly declines — despite being up on Friday — is just too much downside, even though there are a bevy of negatives.

We got a strong close on Thursday and were looking for a nice boost today and we got it. Bulls sort of fumbled the ball late in the session but recovered a bulk of their miscues by the close.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

So, what now?

As you can see on the chart here, the $405 area is tricky. There we have last week’s low and this week’s resistance. It also has active resistance in the form of the 10-day moving average.

If we can clear this area, perhaps the $410 to $412 zone could be on the table, followed by a rally all the way up to the 21-day moving average. That all said, keep in mind what direction the trend has been in — down.

If we move lower again, watch today’s low at $395.61. A break of that — which is roughly Thursday’s high, too — then $392 is on the table. Below $389, and the lows are back in play near $385.

Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 2: Costco (COST) Top stock trades for COST

Costco (NASDAQ:COST) has traded lower for five-straight weeks now but is giving us a doji week as it rests on the 50-week moving average.

If Costco stock can go weekly-up over $510.63, then bulls could enjoy more upside. Keep in mind, though, the 200-day moving average is near this level, so it’s an important area for the stock to clear and stay above.

If it can do that, it puts the $535 area in play, which is the declining 10-week and 21-week moving averages. Above that puts $545 in play, which is the 50% retracement.

Story continues

On the downside, however, keep an eye on $490. If Costco tips lower, we could be looking at a retest of the lows near $480.

Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 3: Affirm Holdings (AFRM) Top stock trades for AFRM

Moving on from some of the stronger names out there, Affirm Holdings (NASDAQ:AFRM) has been crushed lately — aside from Friday’s powerful post-earnings jump on solid results.

The stock is gapping up into prior support near $26 and the 10-day moving average. If it can’t reclaim this area, then this month’s low remains vulnerable.

However, if the stock can power higher from here, bulls can look to the $32.50 area, then the $37.50 zone. In between these two measures sits the 50-day and 10-week moving averages and they could be resistance.

Top Trades for Monday No. 4: Aurora Cannabis (ACB) Daily chart of ACB stock

Source: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider

Aurora Cannabis (NASDAQ:ACB) is also rallied on earnings on Friday. It too has overhead resistance right above it, in the form of $2.90 and the 10-day.

If it can push through this area, keep an eye out for the 21-day, which isn’t too far above this area.

However, if Aurora can really gain some steam, $3.40 is in play, followed by $3.65. These two levels are the 50-day and 50% retracement, and the 61.8% retracement and daily VWAP measure, respectively.

On the downside, though, failure to reclaim and/or hold above $2.90 keeps the May low in play.

The reason for this rally is red-hot inflation and the resultant hawkish stance taken by the Fed.

April’s U.S. inflation print strengthened expectations that the Fed will continue its aggressive rate hike spree. The Fed hiked the rate in March by 25 bps and in May by 50- bps (which is a highest magnitude in two decades). Markets are pricing in another 190-basis-point rate hike in 2022.

The U.S. dollar index rose to fresh two-decade highs as concerns that tighter monetary policies to tame surging inflation will slow global economic growth, which in turn has weighed on risk sentiment and driven investors toward the safe-haven currency greenback.

It appears to be a win-win situation for the greenback as the global health crisis as well as the economic slowdown have not dissipated yet. This fact provides support to the safe-haven trades. On the other hand, continued vaccination might reverse the pandemic-induced economic slowdown in the United States and bring the economy back onto a faster growth path, which will boost the country’s currency.

Given the above-mentioned facts, the bullish trend in the greenback is likely to continue, at least in the near term.

ETFs to Buy

So, investors looking to play the strengthening U.S. dollar could consider the below-mentioned ETFs:

U.S. Dollar

The dollar strength can sure be played with UUP and WisdomTree Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Bullish Fund USDU.

Small Caps

Since small caps are closely tied to the U.S. economy and do not get affected by a rising dollar due to their limited foreign exposure, iShares Russell 2000 ETF IWM could be a good pick. Most large-cap U.S. companies are flocking to protect their profits by currency hedging due to a relentless rally in the dollar.

Hedging activity by Monex's clients rose 22% in March 2022 from March 2021, and was up 24% for the first quarter compared with last year, per vice president of dealing and trading at Monex USA, as quoted on a Reuters article. Thus, small-cap investing is more prudent at this time.

Dollar-Denominated Bond ETFs

Investors seeking EM exposure amid a strong dollar can consider dollar-denominated EM bond ETFs. These funds invest in sovereign debt from a variety of emerging nations via U.S. dollar-denominated securities. Notably, the debt route is less risky than equities. Moreover, most emerging markets have low debt levels compared to the developed countries.

Invesco BulletShares 2024 USD Emerging Markets Debt ETF BSDE is one such ETF. The fund yields 3% annually and is off only 3.8% this year. The decline in returns is pretty low compared to several other investment alternatives.

ETFs to Lose

Inverse Dollar Fund

Needless to say, if the dollar is rising, a short position on the currency would result in negative returns. Invesco DB US Dollar Index Bearish Fund UDN should thus be avoided.

Commodities: Gold

The upsurge in the dollar is bad for raw materials and commodities as these are priced in the U.S. dollar. Furthermore, prolonged strength in the U.S. dollar might constrict the growth picture, which in turn would weigh on commodities’ prices. SPDR Gold Shares GLD lost 1.5% on May 12 due to a sudden dollar strength. Having said this, we would like to note that commodities have been strong this year thanks to the war in East Europe and high inflation.

Large Caps

Since large-cap stocks have greater foreign exposure, the strengthening dollar is negative for this capitalization. BofA Global Research once estimated that every 10% drop in the U.S. dollar translates into about a 3% boost to S&P earnings, as quoted on Reuters. It is expected that the opposite will happen if the greenback surges.

Companies pointing to currency headwinds in their latest earnings reports include Coca-Cola Co, Procter & Gamble and Philip Morris International Inc. Analysts have cut their overall forecast for S&P 500 second-quarter profit growth to 5.6% from 6.8% at the start of April owing to the current headwinds, per a Reuters article. SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY should thus be closely watched.

RACHELLE AKUFFO: Welcome back to ""Yahoo Finance Live"" everyone. We're just two minutes away from the closing bell, and the major indices continuing their descent. Let's get a break down with our very own Ines Ferre. Ines, how's it looking?

INES FERRE: Well, Rachelle, we started the day out choppy. And we are ending on a down note, near the lows of the session. Take a look at our Wi-Fi interactive board. You're looking at the Dow. That's down 330 points, the NASDAQ the biggest loser out of the indices, down more than 3%. In fact, year to date this NASDAQ is down 27%.

The S&P 500 is set to close below that key 4,000 level. Taking a look under the hood at equities, we are seeing on our sector action that we are looking at consumer discretionary getting hit, technology stocks getting hit, communication services as well. You are seeing energy stocks, which have been the outperformers throughout the day.

Over on the NASDAQ 100, look at the left-hand side of the screen. The mega caps, they are down, with Amazon part of consumer discretionary down 3%, Tesla down 8%, Apple down 5%, and Meta down 4%.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/market-check-energy-outperforms-big-201005977.html,"['AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'ABEA.F', 'ABEA.XETRA', 'ABEC.F', 'ABEC.XETRA', 'AMZ.F', 'AMZ.XETRA', 'AMZN.MX', 'AMZN.US', 'AMZO34.SA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA', 'CHV.F', 'CHV.XETRA', 'CVX.MX', 'CVX.US']",[],"{'polarity': 0.586, 'neg': 0.024, 'neu': 0.926, 'pos': 0.05}"
404,2022-05-11T12:31:35+00:00,Inflation decelerates slightly from 40-year high as CPI rises 8.3% in April,"U.S. consumer prices rose at a slightly slower pace in April compared to March, though persistent supply-side disruptions still kept inflation near its highest level in 40 years. And core consumer prices rose more than anticipated even while decelerating compared to March, suggesting underlying inflationary trends across the economy remained hot.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics' April Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 8.3% in April over last year, coming down from March's 8.5% advance. That rise had marked the fastest rate since 1981. Consensus economists were expecting an 8.1% increase in April, according to Bloomberg.

On a month-over-month basis, the broadest measure of CPI increased by 0.3%, compared to March's 1.2% rise.

Heading into Wednesday's report, many economists had expected the CPI would decelerate in April compared to the prior month, showing at least tentative a sign that March was the peak rate of inflation for the year. However, the latest data showed a smaller-than-expected slowdown in inflation across both the headline and core measures.

And much of the deceleration in CPI for April came from the volatile energy component. This had been expected, since prices for crude oil, gas and other energy commodities moderated in April after spiking in March immediately following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

And indeed, the energy price index fell 2.7% in April compared to March, after soaring by 11% during the previous month. Within this category, the motor fuel index dropped 5.8% and the gasoline index dropped by 6.1%, and energy commodities index dipped by 5.4% compared to March.

“The pace of price increases moderated, but not as much as expected. Excluding a decline in energy prices – which appears outdated by this point – the increases remain widespread,"" Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate, said in an email Wednesday morning. ""With the annual rate ticking down from 8.5% to 8.3, it can be tempting to say we’ve seen the peak, but we’ve also been head-faked before as was the case last August.”

Story continues A person shops for groceries and household products in Alhambra, California, on April 12, 2022. - Americans paid more for gasoline, food and other essentials last month amid an ongoing wave of record inflation made worse by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, according to government data released Tuesday.

And even excluding energy and the similarly volatile food category, core CPI decelerated only modestly in April compared to March. Core CPI rose by 6.2% last month over last year, following March's 6.5% increase. And on a month-over-month basis, core CPI rose 0.3%, compared to the 0.4% rate expected.

Shelter prices, considered one of the stickier price categories, rose by 0.5% on a monthly basis in April for a third consecutive month. Prices for new vehicles also accelerated markedly, jumping 1.1% for the fastest monthly rise since December. And other reopening-related categories also ramped up in April, including airline fares, which jumped 18.6% to build on March's 10.7% monthly rise.

For investors, the latest inflation report serves as a closely watched gauge of the inflation Americans are experiencing for groceries, gas, housing and a variety of other goods and services. Though some consumption data and company reports have suggested consumers are still spending despite rising prices, investors have been closely watching to see whether persistently high inflation eventually curbs consumption significantly. This would in turn drag on U.S. economic growth, which depends most heavily on consumer spending.

And the CPI data also acts as an indicator of how much action the Federal Reserve may need to take in order to bring inflation back down to its 2% target. With inflation having run well above that level for the past year, the central bank has already raised interest rates by a total of 75 basis points across two Federal Open Market Committee meetings in the past three months, while signaling more rate hikes are in the pipeline for this year.

In fact, the S&P 500 has suffered the longest weekly losing streak since 2011. The benchmark is down 13.5% year to date. SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, the proxy version of the S&P 500 Index, has plunged about 12.6%.

While most of the stocks in SPY’s portfolio are deep in red, a few have outperformed so far this year, with energy stocks being the biggest gainers. We have highlighted stocks from various corners of the market that have gained in double digits. These include Occidental Petroleum Corporation OXY, CF Industries CF, McKesson Corporation MCK, Archer Daniels Midland Company ADM and Lockheed Martin LMT. All these stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).

Fed Chair Jerome Powell raised interest rates by 50 bps, pushing the benchmark above 0.75%. The hike marks the biggest interest-rate increase since 2000. With inflation running at a 40-year high of 8.5%, the central bank also signaled that it would keep hiking at the same pace over the next couple of meetings. Signals that the Fed will not consider a rate hike by 75 bps at a future meeting were welcomed by investors initially but evaporated later, on worries about the impact of the Fed’s moves on the broader economy (read: 4 ETFs to Ride on Fed's 50 Bps Rate Hike).

An increase in interest rates means higher loan rates for consumers and businesses, including mortgages, credit cards and auto loans. Additionally, supply chain issues stemming from the spike in COVID-19 cases in China and the ongoing war in Ukraine are weighing on investor sentiment.

Let’s take a closer look at the fundamentals of SPY.

SPY in Focus

SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust holds 504 stocks in its basket, with each accounting for no more than 7% of assets. This suggests a nice balance across each security and prevents heavy concentration. The fund is widely spread across sectors with information technology, healthcare, consumer discretionary, financials and communication services accounting for a double-digit allocation each.

SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust has AUM of $374.5 billion and charges 9 bps in fees per year. The product trades in a heavy volume of around 88.3 million shares a day on average, ensuring higher liquidity with a tight bid/ask spread, leading to lower trading costs for investors. SPY has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy) with a Medium risk outlook (see: all the Large Cap Blend ETFs here).

Below we have highlighted the above-mentioned five best-performing stocks in the ETF from different industries.

415,2022-05-05T22:14:20+00:00,Stock market news live updates: Stock futures steady after sell-off,"U.S. stock futures opened little changed Thursday evening after a sharp sell-off on Wall Street, as concerns over the Federal Reserve's ability to bring down inflation while maintaining solid economic activity resurged.

Contracts on the S&P 500 drifted sideways. This came after the index shed 3.6% during the regular trading day, as technology stocks underperformed. The Nasdaq dropped 5% for its worst day since June 2020, and the Dow lost more than 1,000 points.

Stocks' violent swing from gains Wednesday to losses Thursday came as investors further appraised the implications of the Federal Reserve's latest telegraphed monetary policy path forward. While investors momentarily cheered Fed Chair Jerome Powell's suggestions that the central bank was not considering raising rates by a more drastic 75 basis points at a time, they have also had to consider whether relatively less aggressive hikes will ultimately be able to bring down inflation currently running at the hottest levels since the 1980s.

""[Wednesday], I think the markets had a sense of relief that maybe Powell took 75 basis points off the table for further rate hikes, suggesting the Fed might take a more mild path,"" Jeffrey Kleintop, Charles Schwab chief global investment strategist, told Yahoo Finance Live on Thursday. ""But [Thursday], I think the market's recognizing that there are risks associated with that — higher inflation, maybe.""

""That's certainly what we're seeing here with [Treasury] yields spiking higher. And to me, this is an enduring theme, this isn't just a one-day phenomenon,"" Kleintop added. ""If you look all the way back to August of 2020, there's been one major theme in the markets, and that is short-duration stocks, meaning low price to cash flow, have been outperforming longer-duration stocks, or high price to cash flow ... and that is a trend that's going to continue here.""

Story continues

Treasury yields on the long end of the curve spiked on Thursday, and the benchmark 10-year yield rose above 3.03%. The ongoing move higher in Treasury yields and borrowing costs has weighed on growth and technology stocks, which are valued heavily on their future earnings potential.

Elsewhere, investors are also looking ahead to Friday's monthly jobs report, which is expected to reaffirm the central bank's assessment that the U.S. labor market remains extremely tight. Non-farm payrolls are expected to have risen by 380,000 in April, which would be a slight slowdown compared with March but still a solid month of job growth. And the unemployment rate is expected to dip to 3.5%, which would match February 2020's level for the lowest since 1969.

""The job market is very tight ... there's tons of geopolitical impacts, especially on things like energy and food, which creeps into everything else. Supply chains remain challenged, and we have now Chinese COVID shutdowns which make it even more stressed,"" Paul Kim, Simplify Asset Management CEO, told Yahoo Finance Live on Thursday. ""Bottom line is, there's too much demand for goods and services and not enough supply. And the Fed can't solve those real-world problems, and I think that's what's solving this indigestion.""

""I don't think we've hit the bottom yet, simply because we're just starting the hiking process,"" Kim added. ""There's arguably hundreds of basis points to go.""

416,2022-05-05T20:34:14+00:00,"4 Top Stock Trades for Friday: SPY, Ethereum, NIO, AMD","Wednesday was a really nice rally for the bulls on strong upside volume. But they found a way to jam this one down and really pull the rug out from under the bulls’ feet. At market close, the New York Stock Exchange experienced a 95% down day on Thursdsay. A second 90% downside day would hurt, but could get us closer to an intermediate-term low. With that in mind, let’s look at a few top stock trades, starting with the S&P 500.

Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: S&P 500 (SPY)

Click to Enlarge

Source: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider

On Wednesday, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY) closed above the 10-day moving average for the first time since April 20. That didn’t last long though with Thursday’s plunge.

Now we’re sitting on last week’s low and prior 2022 support near $410. If it fails, it opens the door to this week’s low near $405, followed by the gap-fill level near $400.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

On the upside, I’d really like to hold this area as support and reclaim the 10-day. If it can do that, the SPY could technically put last week’s high and this week’s high in play near $429.50. Above that and the rally can continue.

Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: Ethereum (ETH-USD)

Click to Enlarge

Source: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider

Cryptocurrency traded well on Wednesday, but like stocks, they got hit hard on Thursday. I laid out Bitcoin (BTC-USD) earlier in the day, so let’s take a look at Ethereum (ETH-USD).

Ethereum is breaking below channel support, as it clings to the April low near $2,720. I know there are some uptrend lines and such to consider, but a break of channel support and the April low would be too overwhelming to me, particularly if Ethereum closes below the latter.

That would have me watching for a test of the $2,500 level, potentially followed by the 2022 low down near $2,150.

On the upside, Ethereum could run back to $3,000 and the 50-day if it can reclaim channel support. Above the 50-day really opens things up, putting the 200-day and $3,500 in play.

Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: Nio (NIO)

Nio (NYSE:NIO) got smoked on the day, down more than 15% and filling the gap from March at $15.35. If it can’t reclaim this level, then investors need to understand that more downside could be in play.

Specifically, I believe the 2022 low would be vulnerable, down near $13. If that level breaks and isn’t reclaimed, then another gap-fill could be in play, with this one all the way down at $9.40.

On the upside, watch for Nio to reclaim $15.35. Above that puts the 10-day in play, followed by the 50-day.

Top Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)

Click to Enlarge

Source: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) ripped higher on earnings yesterday but stalled right at the prior support zone in the $99 to $100 zone. Reclaiming this level would be huge for the bulls.

While AMD stock faded a bit on Thursday, the plus side is that it’s holding the 10-day and 21-day moving averages.

If it can continue to do so, $100 remains on the table. Above $100 would technically put the 50-day in play, but I would have my eyes on the $112 to $117 area, where we find several larger timeframe measures like the 50-week and 200-day moving averages and the weekly VWAP measure.

If AMD stock breaks the 10-day and 21-day and can’t reclaim them, then the $85 area is back on the table.

418,2022-05-05T18:49:03+00:00,April jobs report preview: Payroll growth set to persist as jobless rate improves to pre-virus low,"U.S. job growth likely remained robust in April as the unemployment rate improved to its pre-virus low, further underscoring the still-tight domestic labor market.

The Labor Department is set to release its monthly jobs report for April on Friday morning at 8:30 a.m. ET. Here are the main metrics expected from the print, compared with consensus data compiled by Bloomberg:

Non-farm payrolls: +380,000 expected, +431,000 in March Unemployment rate: 3.5% expected, 3.6% in March Average hourly earnings, month-over-month: 0.4% expected, 0.4% in March Average hourly earnings, year-over-year: 5.5% expected, 5.6% in March

The U.S. economy has brought back an average of over half a million payrolls per month so far in 2022. At 380,000, the expected payroll additions for April would mark the least in a year, but still represent growth well-above pre-pandemic trends. Throughout 2019, payroll growth had averaged about 164,000 per month.

""Demand for labor remains strong, though with the market much closer to full employment, the pace of monthly hiring gains should continue to ease over the coming months,"" Sam Bullard, Wells Fargo senior economist, wrote in a note earlier this week. ""We expect to see broad based hiring – with sizable gains from leisure and hospitality and other services-related sectors which are increasingly getting back on their feet following the COVID hibernation.""

Indeed, services-based employers have brought back some of the most jobs in recent months, as companies hastened to hire back workers let go during the pandemic to meet renewed consumer demand. While leisure and hospitality employment is still down by about 1.5 million jobs compared with February 2020 levels, that gap has narrowed markedly over the past year.

Meanwhile, the unemployment rate is expected to dip further to 3.5%. This would match February 2020's level for the lowest since 1969.

Wages are also expected to climb yet again, rising 0.4% month-on-month to match March's rate. And though average hourly earnings will likely slow slightly on a year-over-year basis, such a clip would still represent a historically quick pace of wage growth.

Story continues

The recent increases in payrolls and wages and decrease in the unemployment rate, however, have not given rise to a commensurate improvement in the financial wellbeing of many Americans. With inflation running at 40-year highs, price increases for consumer goods have outpaced earnings growth. The U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) last rose at an 8.5% year-on-year rate in March or the fastest since 1981, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

""So many people seemed to be banking that if we could get unemployment down to 1st quarter 2020 levels, everything would be fine,"" Giacomo Santangelo, economist at the employment platform Monster, said in an email. ""What we are finding now is while the unemployment situation has improved on a macroeconomic scale, individuals are facing rising prices that are threatening their standard of living.""

Amid persistent inflation, the Federal Reserve earlier this week opted to raise interest rates further and announced the start of quantitative tightening, or rolling assets off the central bank's $9 trillion balance sheet. At his post-Fed meeting press conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell expressed optimism that the moves would succeed in addressing some of the demand-side factors contributing to inflation and that, combined with some easing in supply-side constraints, these would help put a cap on rising prices.

""Wages are running high, the highest they've run in quite some time. And they are one good example ... of how tight the labor market really is,"" Powell said during his press conference Wednesday. ""The fact that wages are running at the highest level in many decades. And that's because of an imbalance between supply and demand in the labor market.""

""So we think through our policies, through further healing in the labor market, higher rates, for example of vacancy filling and things like that, and more people coming back in we'd like to think that supply and demand will come back into balance,"" he added. ""And that, therefore, wage inflation will moderate to still high levels of wage increases, but ones that are more consistent with 2% inflation. That's our expectation.""

This post will be updated with the results of the April jobs report Friday at 8:30 a.m. ET. Check back for updates.

420,2022-05-04T22:19:07+00:00,"Stock market news live updates: Stock futures edge lower after rally, as traders digest Fed decision","U.S. stock futures opened slightly lower Wednesday evening after a rally on Wall Street, when many investors breathed a sigh of relief that the Federal Reserve was unlikely to raise interest rates even more aggressively in the coming months.

Contracts on the S&P 500 dipped. Earlier, the blue-chip index posted it best single-session gain since May 2020, rising 2.99%. The Nasdaq Composite surged by 3.2%, and the Dow added more than 900 points, or 2.8%.

The jump came in the wake of the Federal Reserve's first half-point rate hike since 2000, as the central bank took a notable step to address inflation currently running at its hottest rates in 40 years. The central bank also laid out its plans to begin rolling assets off its $9 trillion balance sheet starting June 1. The pace of this announced balance sheet reduction largely matched Wall Street's expectations heading into Wednesday's Fed statement.

But importantly, during his press conference Thursday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell suggested the central bank was not currently discussing plans to raise interest rates by 75 basis points in the near-term. Some had feared such a move would issue too strong a jolt to the economy already showing some signs of slowing. Still, Powell suggested that there was a ""broad sense among the committee that additional 50 basis point increases should be on the table at the next couple of meetings.""

“Markets got what they asked for today as the Fed delivered on a 50-basis point hike in the policy rate. With little signs of inflation cooling, the Fed has its sights on bringing the policy rate to a more neutral level in a relatively short order,"" Chris Ripley, senior investment strategist at Allianz Investment Management, wrote in an email. ""Hiking rates at 50 basis points per meeting is fairly benign considering that market expectations are already priced in. What matters more is where the direction of inflation is headed once the lagging Fed policy has caught up.”

Story continues

But even in absence of supersized 75 basis-point rate hikes, the Fed's path toward raising interest rates from ultra-low levels and embarking on quantitative tightening still presents a risk to economic growth, with markets having grown accustomed to the central bank's accommodative monetary policies during the pandemic. Powell himself acknowledged that some trade-off would take place between bringing inflation down and maintaining economic activity.

“There may be some pain associated with getting back to that, but the big pain is in not dealing with inflation and allowing it to become entrenched,” Powell said during his press conference.

Others also underscored these risks.

""In all policy moves, there are negative consequences, which hopefully are muted, and are less impactful than the issue that is being addressed and today that issue is inflation,” Rick Rieder, BlackRock chief investment officer of global fixed income, wrote in an email Wednesday. “The consequences we risk in policy tightening are potential recession, potential lost jobs and wages, and clearly tighter financial conditions that will weigh on virtually all financial markets.”

“There are many factors out of the Fed’s control (supply chain disruptions and geopolitics, for instance), but we’ll be watching closely to see how the Fed’s tightening of financial conditions impacts the broad economy and employment levels, which are very firm today but can clearly soften alongside of aggressive inflation-fighting monetary policy,” Rieder added.

422,2022-05-04T12:16:47+00:00,"Private payrolls rose by 247,000 in April, missing expectations","Payrolls rose less-than-expected in the U.S. private sector last month, as employers worked to fill persistent vacancies to help meet demand.

Private-sector payrolls grew by 247,000 in April,ADP said in its closely watched monthly report on Wednesday. This came following an increase of 479,000 private payrolls in March, according to ADP's revised monthly print. Consensus economists were looking for private payrolls to rise by 383,000, according to Bloomberg data.

The U.S. services sector saw the largest gains in private payrolls last month, with nearly every industry group adding back jobs. However, job growth slowed compared to March, contributing to the headline deceleration in total private payroll gains.

Leisure and hospitality employers added back 77,000 jobs in April, which while still the most of any industry group, was less than half the gain in payrolls from March. This was followed by professional and business services, with payrolls rising by 50,000 in April, and education and health services with gains of 48,000. In the goods-producing sector, payrolls grew on net in each of the manufacturing, construction and mining industries.

ADP's monthly private jobs report comes, as usual, two days before the Labor Department releases its official jobs report. While ADP's report typically does not serve as a perfect indicator of what to expect in the government-issued data due to differences in survey methodology, the print has often helped give a direction sense of job growth that took place during a given period.

Despite these discrepancies, the underlying trend amid the plethora of recent labor market data has been clear: the U.S. labor market remains extremely tight, with demand for workers far outstripping supply. In March, job openings raced to a record high of more than 11.5 million, while new hires were little changed at 6.7 million. And these vacancies have persisted even after months of payroll growth coming in well above pre-pandemic trends.

""For households, the trend in job growth is important,"" Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics, wrote in a note. ""Recent labor market data suggest conditions are tight and showing no signs of deterioration. Layoffs are close to 50-year lows.""

""Rising nominal wages are supporting demand, enabling businesses to successfully pass on higher input and labor costs, without much pushback from consumers,"" she added. ""But we are watching for signs of a pullback, as rates move higher and prices remain elevated, or even continue rising. Not only will this affect the trajectory for growth, it will also limit companies' ability to maintain margins and profitability, which in turn will impact investment and hiring decisions.""

In Friday's government-issued jobs report, consensus economists are looking for non-farm payrolls to increase by 385,000 on net for April, with private payrolls rising by a slightly more robust 390,000 in total. This would follow non-farm payrolls growth of 431,000 in March. And the unemployment rate is expected to improve further to reach 3.5%, matching February 2020's level for the lowest since 1969.

423,2022-05-03T22:13:35+00:00,Stock market news live updates: Stock futures drift as traders brace for Fed decision,"U.S. stock futures opened little changed Tuesday evening, with investors looking ahead to the Federal Reserve's latest monetary policy decision against the backdrop of elevated inflation and a still-tight U.S. labor market. Contracts on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq gained, while Dow futures dipped.

Investors are awaiting the Federal Reserve's monetary policy statement and press conference from Chair Jerome Powell later Wednesday afternoon. The central bank is widely expected to raise interest rates by 50 basis points for the first time since 2000. Such a hike would be double the 25 basis-point increase the Fed unleashed in mid-March, which itself had been the first rate hike since 2018. This would bring the target range for the federal funds rate between 0.75% and 1.00%, compared to the current range of between 0.25% and 0.50%.

Expectations for this supersized rate hike have built for weeks now amid market participants, especially given commentary from key Federal Reserve officials appearing to support such a move. Powell said during a public appearance with the International Monetary Fund earlier this month that he believed it would be ""appropriate ... to be moving a little more quickly"" on raising rates, and that 50 basis points were ""on the table"" for May. And the Fed is also expected to use the May meeting to announce the start of quantitative tightening, or rolling assets off the central bank's $9 trillion balance sheet.

Prospects of higher interest rates have stirred up volatility in equity markets, which had grown accustomed over the past two years to ultra-low interest rates and generally easy-money monetary policies. At the same time, however, many pundits have suggested the Fed allowed its pandemic-era supportive policies to run too long, allowing inflation to soar to the fastest rates since the 1980s. And after GDP growth turned negative in the U.S. in the first three months of the year, a lingering question remains whether the Fed will now be able to tighten policies without tipping the economy into a deep downturn.

Story continues

""Because the market has priced in a 50 basis point rate hike at the Federal Reserve's May meeting, the focus will immediately shift to just how many half-point hikes the Fed expects to initiate over the balance of 2022,"" Danielle DiMartino Booth, CEO and chief strategist of Quill Intelligence, wrote in an email Tuesday. ""The Fed would shock markets if it failed to deliver on more aggressive policy via a 50 basis point rate hike on Wednesday.""

""The Federal Reserve's credibility is on the line, given the surge in inflation, which has proved to be anything but transitory,"" Booth added. ""Interest rates are too low and markets have been way too accustomed to almost unlimited liquidity from the Fed's bond purchases. Powell's greatest folly would be to insist that the economy is very strong in the face of overwhelming evidence that it is slowing and slowing fast.""

424,2022-05-03T14:00:48+00:00,US job openings rose to a record 11.549 million in March,"U.S. job openings rose to a record level in March, with labor demand still outpacing supply across many firms throughout the country.

Job openings increased to 11.549 million in March, the Labor Department said in its Job Openings and Labor Turnover Summary (JOLTS) on Tuesday. Job openings had totaled 11.344 million in February, based on the revised monthly print. Consensus economists were looking for job openings to decline to 11.200 million for March, according to Bloomberg data.

The number of vacancies across the U.S. economy has held sharply above the number of hires, which were little changed month-on-month at 6.7 million in March. And the number of quits also edged up to a record high of 4.5 million, with the quits rate hovering little changed at 3.0%.

By industry, job openings rose significantly among retail trade employers, with vacancies increasing by 155,000 month-on-month. Durable goods manufacturing industries also saw vacancies rise by 50,000 in March. On the other hand, vacancies decreased by 69,000 in transportation, warehousing and utilities industries, and by 43,000 in state and local government education.

Job openings across the board, however, remain well above pre-pandemic levels, as vacancies were averaging around just 7.1 million per month throughout 2019. And these openings have remained even as firms have brought back workers at rates well above pre-virus levels for much of the past year.

""Businesses have hired some 3.5M people in the past six months, almost triple the pace we'd expect to see in the middle of a normal cycle, so they must be making inroads into their hiring backlog. This pace of hiring can't be sustained indefinitely, and some surveys point to a slowdown over the next few months,"" Ian Shepherdson, chief economist for Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a note. ""But it's important to distinguish between normalization in job growth and a late cycle downshift. We see little near-term risk of the latter.""

Story continues

Labor scarcities have remained one of the major sources of pressure on U.S. companies in recent months, leading to a dearth of workers to keep pace with demand. This mismatch of supply and demand has also pushed wages higher, which while benefitting workers, has led many companies to pass on their additional costs to consumers and contribute to already decades-high rates of inflation. Consumer prices last rose by 8.5% in March over last year, while average hourly earnings rose by 5.6%.

Later this week, the Labor Department's latest monthly jobs report will provide an updated snapshot of the strength in hiring across the U.S. As of Tuesday, consensus economists expected that non-farm payrolls rose by 390,000 in April, which would slow just slightly from March's increase of 431,000. The unemployment rate is expected to dip to 3.5%, matching February 2020's level for the lowest since 1969.

The April jobs report is set for release Friday at 8:30 a.m. ET.

425,2022-05-02T22:18:36+00:00,Stock market news live updates: Stocks futures edge lower after tech rally,"U.S. stock futures opened slightly lower Monday evening after a whipsaw session in markets during the regular trading day, as investors appraised the next moves by the Federal Reserve and a fresh batch of quarterly earnings results.

Contracts on the S&P 500 declined. During the regular trading day, technology stocks outperformed, leading the S&P 500 higher by 0.6%, and the Nasdaq up by 1.6%. And these moves in tech shares came even as the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield topped 3%, or its highest level since December 2018. In recent months, a rise in yields has coincided with a drop in tech shares, which are considered more vulnerable to higher rates that would weigh on growth stocks' valuations.

The market moves at the start of this week stood in stark contrast to what investors endured over the past several weeks, when heightened volatility and selling pulled the major equity averages sharply lower. The S&P 500 posted an 8.8% decline in April for its worst month since March 2020.

""Volatility skews in both directions. In this period when we expect heightened volatility because of all of the confluence of factors that we see from geopolitics to earnings to the Fed to inflation, you're going to have big swings like this,"" Ross Mayfield, Baird investment strategy analyst, told Yahoo Finance Live. ""I think at a certain point, buyers do see some value in there. If you're of the opinion that we're not going to enter a recession ... I think you start to see some value investors start to take some bites.""

Still, given the variety of concerns still present for the market outlook, many strategists have struck a more cautious tone on U.S. stocks for the near-term. In a note published Friday, Bank of America strategists led by Savita Subramanian slashed their price target on the S&P 500 by 100 points to 4,500.

""This year's market does not appear to be dominated by one factor, be it fundamentals or positioning, cost of capital or corporate outlooks, but has been reacting to all of the above in big swings,"" the analysts wrote.

Story continues

And this week, investors are bracing for the Federal Reserve's latest monetary policy decision, which is set to include measures intended to accelerate the central bank's fight to bring down elevated inflation, even at the expense of some economic growth. Investors are looking for the Fed to raise rates by 50 basis points for the first time since 2000, and to officially announce the timing of the start of quantitative tightening, or the rolling of assets off the Fed's $9 trillion balance sheet.

""There's no doubt that there's some anticipation out there of [Fed officials'] comments and their action, Katie Stockton, Fairlead Strategies founder, told Yahoo Finance Live. ""We're seeing that in the marketplace. It's very, very skittish, and probably reasonably so.""

""I think we all kind of know what's coming. And yet sometimes that doesn't matter. Sometimes the market comes into it and it can be deeply oversold,"" she added. ""I think it's a pretty risky assumption to make in this kind of environment ... I mean there's hardly any stocks that have been unturned by the recent weakness. So I think we have to keep those risks in mind as we come into the numbers.""

426,2022-05-02T11:44:26+00:00,Stock market news live updates: Stock futures rise as traders attempt to shake off April losses,"U.S. stock futures headed for a higher open on Monday, with equities looking to steady in the first session of May following one of the worst monthly performances for the S&P 500 since the depths of the pandemic in 2020.

Contracts on the S&P 500 were higher by about 0.2% in pre-market trading. Dow and Nasdaq futures also gained. U.S. crude oil prices fell to hover above $101 per barrel, and the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield held above 2.9%, or near its highest level since December 2018.

Investors this week are bracing for more potentially market-moving events to take place following April's volatile stretch of trading. The S&P 500 sank by 8.8% in April for its worst monthly performance since March 2020. Tech stocks especially were battered, and the Nasdaq Composite slid by 13% last month for its worst since October 2008.

The Federal Reserve's next monetary policy-setting meeting will be especially closely watched in the days ahead, with the central bank poised to release its latest policy statement and hold a press conference with Fed Chair Jerome Powell Wednesday afternoon. Market participants expect the Fed will raise rates by 50 basis points at the end of this meeting, marking the first rate hike of that magnitude since 2000. This would follow the 25 basis-point rate hike the Fed carried out in March, bringing the target range for the federal funds rate to between 0.25% and 0.50% and raising the low end of the range above zero for the first time since March 2020.

The Fed is also expected to formally announce that it will begin quantitative tightening, or rolling assets off of its $9 trillion balance sheet. The central had scooped up assets and added to its balance sheet over the course of the pandemic as another means of helping support the virus-stricken economy. However, expectations for the undoing of this build have stirred up volatility after markets became accustomed to these easy money policies.

Story continues

And with U.S. GDP growth turning negative for the first time since mid-2020 in the first quarter of this year, some pundits have begun to question whether the Fed will be able to tighten monetary policies without setting off a deeper downturn in economic activity.

""Recession risk has risen, and the financial health of the private sector may ultimately determine whether policy tightening will tilt the economy into a downturn,"" Goldman Sachs Chief Economist Jan Hatzius wrote in a note Sunday. ""Financial fragility in the private sector has historically amplified the impact of the headwinds confronting today's expansion: higher interest rates, rapid wage inflation, and slowing growth.""

Meanwhile, earnings season will also press on this week, with a number of closely watched companies from Airbnb (ABNB) to Uber (UBER) and Lyft (LYFT) and Block Inc. (SQ) each reporting results. Heading into this week, 55% of S&P 500 components had reported actual first-quarter results, and of these, 80% topped earnings per share estimates, while 72% exceeded revenue expectations, according to data from FactSet.

The expected earnings growth rate for S&P 500 companies in aggregate has also now risen to 7.1%, up from the 4.7% seen at the end of March, FactSet noted. Still, if 7.1% remains the actual earnings growth rate for the index in the first quarter, it would mark the slowest rate since the fourth quarter of 2020.

427,2022-05-01T14:24:59+00:00,"Federal Reserve meeting, April jobs report: What to know in markets this week","After a brutal month for equity investors in April, May is kicking off with a host of major market events that could further stoke volatility across risk assets.

One of the focal points this week will be the Federal Reserve's May monetary policy meeting, which will take place Tuesday and Wednesday. Market participants expect at the conclusion of this meeting, central bank officials will opt to raise interest rates by 50 basis points, representing the first hike of more than 25 basis points since 2000. Investors also expect the Fed to formally announce plans to start rolling assets off the central bank's balance sheet, beginning the process of quantitative tightening.

As of Friday, Fed funds futures showed traders were pricing in a more than 99% probability that the Fed would increase rates by 50 basis points, bringing the target range for the federal funds rate to between 0.75% and 1.00%.

These expectations came after weeks of remarks from key Fed officials including Fed Chair Jerome Powell and Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard, which suggested the Fed was warming to the idea of raising rates more aggressively in the near-term.

“We really are committed to using our tools to get 2% inflation back,"" Powell said during a public appearance with the International Monetary Fund earlier this month.""It is appropriate in my view to be moving a little more quickly. And I also think there is something in the idea of front-end loading … that points to the direction of 50 basis points being on the table.”

Such a move would accelerate the Fed's path toward bringing down inflation, which has persisted for a longer period of time and at a higher rate than many monetary policymakers initially anticipated. Last week, government data showed core personal consumptions expenditures (PCE) — the Fed's preferred inflation gauge — rose at a 5.2% annual rate in March.

This nearly matching February's rate for the fastest since 1983. And consumer prices soared last month by the most since December 1981 with an 8.5% annual surge.

“They’re behind the curve – they know they’re behind the curve,"" Jim Smigiel, SEI Investments chief investment officer, told Yahoo Finance Live last week. ""We’re plus-8% on inflation and [the Fed funds rate] is at a quarter point. They’re going to come in at 50 [basis points]. They’re going to do 50 again. And they’re going to start talking down the balance sheet.""

""From the Fed’s perspective, they at this stage are willing to trade a little GDP and a little bit of unemployment to get the inflation rate down,"" Smigiel added. ""I think they feel as though they’re backed into a bit of a corner. Nothing that’s happening today is going to set them off course. They’re going to be coming in early and guns blazing a bit.” WASHINGTON DC, USA - MARCH 21: Jerome Powell, Chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve, speaks during the National Association of Business Economics (NABE) economic policy conference in Washington, D.C, United States on March 21, 2022.

At the same time, Powell also suggested he believes the central bank will succeed in tightening monetary policy while maintaining the economic expansion. Some pundits, however, have been more skeptical, especially after new data last week showed the U.S. economy contracted at a 1.4% annualized rate at the beginning of this year.

""They're in between rock and a hard place,"" David Stryzewski, Sound Planning Group CEO, told Yahoo Finance Live last week. ""The two big things that they have to defend against right now, inflation and then this balance between, we want low cost for lending ... because there's a lot of people out trying to get mortgages. We've got a lot of our economy based on businesses with high debt. And it's been so easy to refinance it.""

""The Fed's late to the table on trying to pull some of this back and make some of these changes,"" he added. ""We were in such a strong economy. And that was really our moment where we could have maybe done some of this tightening. So we're a little bit late.""

Still, borrowing costs remain low on a historical basis, and consumers have still shown a general propensity to spend. Whether that ultimately manages to continue as the cost of doing business rises alongside interest rates and as financial conditions tighten further, however, remains the key question.

""We think recession risks are low for now but elevated for 2023. The key risk is that inflation remains elevated next year, forcing the Fed to hike until it hurts,"" Ethan Harris, Bank of America global economist, wrote in a note Friday. ""Besides inflation, investors should watch consumer spending, sentiment, labor supply and the front end of the yield curve to assess recession risks.""

April jobs report

The Labor Department's latest monthly jobs report will round out the economic data docket this week, offering an updated snapshot of the strength of the labor market so far this year.

The report is due for release on Friday, and so will not be one of the datapoints considered during the Fed's deliberations earlier in the week. However, the data likely would have played an only marginal role in informing the Fed's decisions even if it were available, given the Fed has shifted its priorities to fighting inflation rather than maximizing employment in a labor market that has already shown copious signs of strength.

Consensus economists are looking for non-farm payrolls to rise by 391,000 in April, slowing just slightly from March's jump of 431,000. The unemployment is expected to improve further to 3.5%, which would match February 2020's level for the lowest rate of joblessness in about 50 years.

Average hourly earnings — a closely watched indicator of whether rising wages are reinforcing a cycle of higher prices — are expected to rise by 5.5% over last year, moderating just slightly from March's 5.6% annual rate. Still, these wage gains have not kept pace with inflation, given consumer prices most recently climbed by 8.5%.

428,2022-04-28T22:23:14+00:00,"Stock market news live updates: Stock futures sink as Amazon, Apple shares decline after quarterly reports","U.S. stock futures opened sharply lower Thursday evening to give back gains after a regular-session rally, with a fresh set of mixed quarterly results from some major technology companies weighing on index futures.

Contracts on the S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq each declined. Shares of tech juggernaut Amazon slid in late trading after the company unexpectedly posted a quarterly loss and offered a weaker-than-expected current-quarter forecast. Apple's stock also declined even after the iPhone-maker exceeded quarterly sales and profit estimates, though the company still cited ongoing supply chain constraints.

Earlier, the S&P 500 closed out Thursday sharply higher, gaining 2.5%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose by 3.1% in its best day since March 16. But even with Thursday's marked gains, the S&P 500 was still on track to post its third monthly decline in four months.

Volatility has resurged in recent weeks amid concerns over whether tighter monetary policies from the Federal Reserve might derail the economy. And these fears compounded with lingering jitters over persistent inflation, geopolitical turmoil and an ongoing COVID outbreak in China. The S&P 500 headed for an about 5% drop in April, if losses hold through Friday's close.

""There's a lot of rerating going on, whether it's the rerating of equity valuations, the rerating of interest rate expectations, or the rerating of inflation expectations, against tightening happening at the Fed,"" Todd Jablonski, Principal Global Asset Allocation chief investment officer, told Yahoo Finance Live. ""The threats of a slower economy, the threats of inflation, and the threats of higher energy prices out of the conflict in Ukraine [are] all sort of coming together to really stymie investor confidence and sentiment.""

Plus, the data this week on corporate profits and the broad economy have been mixed. Results from Big Tech companies including Alphabet and Twitter pointed to a slowdown in online ad businesses as companies pull back on marketing spending in the wake of moderating consumer demand. And throughout this earnings season, a plethora of companies across industries have pointed to elevated input and labor costs, as well as ongoing supply chain disruptions.

Story continues

Against this backdrop, the U.S. economy contracted for the first time since the second quarter of 2020 at the start of this year, government data Thursday showed. The 1.4% annualized contraction in first-quarter U.S. GDP came as net trade, inventories and government investment each weighed on overall domestic output, and as consumer spending came in less robustly than expected.

However, the weaker-than-expected GDP print may also bolster the case for members of the Federal Reserve to exercise more caution as they prepare to raise interest rates further and begin rolling assets off the central bank's balance sheet. These moves would raise borrowing costs and help bring down demand to stem inflation — but also risk tipping the economy into a deeper downturn if financial conditions tighten too quickly.

“There’s just so much concern around, do we go into a recession in the next 24 months because the Fed may just raise interest rates too much?” Ryan Payne, Payne Capital Management president, told Yahoo Finance Live. “I think that’s what’s really weighing on the markets, and more so than the fact that we have a war in Ukraine and these inflationary numbers have just been through the roof.”

430,2022-04-28T19:27:32+00:00,"Amazon earnings preview: Slower revenue growth, strength in Amazon AWS","Amazon (AMZ) is the last of Big Tech names set to unveil quarterly earnings this reporting season, with results due out after the closing bell Thursday. The latest figures will give investors a gauge of how the company’s e-commerce business fared in the face of persisting inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions, lower demand for online services as consumers resume in-person activities, and unionization efforts across Amazon warehouses.

Stock watchers will also focus on whether revenue generated from the tech behemoth’s cloud-computing platform Amazon Web Services (AWS) offset expected weakness in its core retail business.

Here's what Wall Street expects Amazon will report for the fiscal first quarter, based on consensus data compiled by Bloomberg:

Revenue: $116.43 billion expected vs. $137.4 billion in Q4 Earnings per share: $8.40 per share expected vs. $5.80 in Q4

Amazon shares have been a laggard among mega-cap technology stocks since last year when the company saw its robust year-over-year growth rates begin to fade following an impressive 2020 driven by a pandemic-stoked surge in online shopping. Many analysts anticipate higher transportation expenses driven by record gas prices and greater labor costs to further weigh on margins in the latest results.

Investment bank Cowen, which recently trimmed its forecast, said in a recent note that supply chain issues, which continue to cause disruption well into this year, could present a risk to its forecast.

Some strategists anticipate pricing power associated with the higher costs of goods due to inflation may give the company a needed profitability boost, along with the recent $20 price increase of a Prime membership.

“We expect revenue and operating income around the high-end of Amazon’s guidance ranges driven by higher product pricing and robust consumer spending, partially offset by higher inflation costs,” Wedbush’s Michael Pachter said in a note, emphasizing the same inflationary pressures strategist worry put a dent in profit also likely benefited the company by driving higher product prices across most of its categories, especially groceries. “Additionally, we believe inflation did not result in a material impact to revenue in the first quarter due to robust consumer spending.”

Story continues The Amazon logo is displayed on a sign outside the company's LDJ5 sortation center, as employees begin voting to unionize a second warehouse in the Staten Island borough of New York City, U.S. April 25, 2022. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid.

Consensus estimates see earnings per share of $8.40, per Bloomberg data – a sharp decline from $15.79 during the first quarter of 2021. The tech titan is also expected to see a significant slowdown in its revenue growth rate, with analysts at Bloomberg forecasting the figure to come in at $116.43 billion from $137.4 billion in the fourth quarter.

While projections for performance of Amazon’s retail business are lackluster, results may get a lift from its high-margin cloud computing business AWS. Last quarter, the flagship platform climbed nearly 40% to $17.8 billion. Sales from AWS are expected to come in at $18.25 billion, a slight deceleration from a strong first quarter but still at an increase of 37%, according to Bloomberg data.

Adding to inflationary pressures is a slew of labor challenges for the company. In addition to a tight labor market driving wage expenses higher, employees at more than 100 U.S.-based Amazon facilities have pushed ahead with unionizing efforts at their workplaces since a historic union victory at a warehouse on Staten Island in New York earlier this month. Investors will also be looking to see how labor trends affected the company's performance during the quarter.

For Bank of America, Amazon remains its top FANG stock for 2022 despite recent challenges. The institution specifically cited AWS strength, as well as an opportunity to improve margins from trailing 12-month lows.

“While retail has slowed somewhat, we think Cloud spend could continue to be a bright spot,” BofA analysts said in a recent note. “Inflation clouds the 2022 margin recovery story, but Amazon remains our top FANG stock.”

432,2022-04-27T19:09:26+00:00,"Q1 GDP Preview: Economists look for growth slowdown amid inflation, Russia-Ukraine war","U.S. economic activity likely decelerated to the slowest rate since mid-2020, with lingering supply chain constraints, inflation, and disruptions amid Russia's war in Ukraine weighing on growth.

The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) is poised to release its initial estimate of first-quarter U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) Thursday at 8:30 a.m. ET. Here are the main metrics expected from the report, based on consensus data compiled by Bloomberg:

GDP annualized, quarter-over-quarter: 1.0% expected, 6.9% in Q4 Personal Consumption: 3.5% expected, 2.5% in Q4 Core Personal Consumption Expenditures, quarter-over-quarter: 5.5% expected, 5.0% in Q4

The GDP report will, as usual, serve as a backwards-looking overview of growth, capturing the January-through-March period. However, the metric is still an important indicator of the momentum the U.S. economy maintained at the start of this year — especially as some pundits now brace for the possibility of a recession in the near to medium term.

And indeed, some of the points used to bolster the case for a downturn likely weighed on the pace of growth in the first quarter. Inflation has run at its hottest rate since the early 1980s, pressuring consumers' propensity to spend. Plus, the Russia-Ukraine war has hit global supply chains that had yet to recover from the pandemic. More recently, a widespread COVID-19 outbreak that ramped up in China last month has also threatened to further hit supply chains and growth.

These myriad concerns will likely manifest in Thursday's GDP report as drags from trade, or ""net exports,"" and inventories. Net exports have dragged on GDP for the past six consecutive quarters, and will likely do so for a seventh in the first quarter of 2022.

The U.S. goods trade deficit raced to a record high in March at more than $125 billion. Imports, which subtract from headline GDP, reached an all-time high and far outpaced exports. And though inventories rose in March, slowing inventory growth earlier in the quarter while supply chain challenges lingered is expected to ultimately pull down Q1 GDP.

Story continues Engineer working on electronics components

""The primary driver of the slowdown is the large reversal in inventory accumulation, which we project to have subtracted two percentage points off headline GDP growth,"" Sam Bullard, senior economist at Wells Fargo Corporate & Investment Banking, wrote in a note. ""Net exports should also act as a drag on top-line growth, slicing off 0.6 percentage points.""

""On the positive side, we look for growth in both consumer spending and business investment to have picked up last quarter, an encouraging sign,"" he added.

Consumer spending, which comprises about two-thirds of domestic activity, is expected to still provide a positive contribution to first-quarter GDP. Though spending slowed in the Commerce Department's monthly retail sales reports, a rotation from goods to services spending during the pandemic recovery and still-resilient consumer savings levels have largely helped buoy consumption.

Business investment is also expected to boost GDP, as the reopening and solid consumer demand prompted companies to invest for future growth. Non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a monthly metric which helps approximate business investments, rose 1% in March, or double the consensus estimate.

""Overall, the core orders and shipments data are signaling positive momentum in business investment and equipment spending,"" Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist for High Frequency Economics, wrote in a note on Tuesday. ""However, there is downside risk to the manufacturing sector from the Ukraine war. Lockdowns in China are also likely to further strain supply networks and exacerbate shortages.""

This post will be updated with the results of the first-quarter GDP report Thursday at 8:30 a.m. ET. Check back for updates.

434,2022-04-27T17:15:00+00:00,Stock ETFs Test Crucial Area Amid Mounting Worries,"Stock ETFs are back near their lows for the year as a plethora of fears haunt investors. The S&P 500 closed at 4,175 on Tuesday, down 13% from its January highs and equal to its lows from March.

Meanwhile, the Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT), a fund that holds large positions in all-important stocks like Apple and Microsoft, closed at $364, a hair below its March lows and down a sizable 22% from its January highs.

Along with persistent inflation and interest rate concerns, investors have had to deal with worries about COVID-related lockdowns in China; Russia cutting off natural gas exports to parts of Europe; and slowing corporate earnings growth.

The cocktail of negative factors caused the stock market to erase its sharp, unexpected gains from March, when at one point, the S&P 500 got to within 3.5% of its highs.

Now the index is back in correction territory, causing investors to wonder if the index will break down to new lows and potentially enter a bear market:

S&P 500

VGT

A drop of 20% or more from the highs is widely regarded as the threshold for a bear market. The S&P 500 would have to fall to around 3,840 to get there. The tech sector, as measured by VGT, is already down more than 20% from its highs, though the threshold is less meaningful for individual sectors and stocks.

Focus Shifts To Earnings

While interest rates will remain critical until the Fed can get a better handle on inflation, the focus on rates lessened slightly this week as yields pulled back from their highs. The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield was last trading at 2.79% versus a high of around 2.95% a week ago.

In the meantime, investors are shifting their attention to earnings. In the first quarter of this year, profits at firms in the S&P 500 were expected to have grown at their slowest pace since the fourth quarter of 2020.

That’s not unexpected, but it’s another head wind stocks have to deal with in an already tough macro environment. If the S&P 500 can avoid falling into a bear market with everything that is working against it, there’s no doubt many investors would consider that an accomplishment.

Story continues

Already In A Bear

But the broad market is one thing; individual sectors and industries are another. One area where a bear market is already fully in swing is in high growth stocks. The ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK), a poster child for the high growth/high valuation group, hit new lows on Wednesday, down a stunning 68% from its record high last February.

I tweeted this chart on Tuesday comparing ARKK’s collapse to the collapse of the Nasdaq-100 during the dot-com crash. The two charts look eerily similar.

However, unlike during the dot-com crash, the collapse of high growth stocks this time around hasn’t bled into the broader markets.

That could be because the largest growth stocks—the Apples, Microsofts and Amazons of the world—aren’t down all that much. Moreover, their high levels of profitability and moderate valuations (compared with the S&P 500) give them plenty of cushion even when sentiment turns sharply against them, as it has today.

Still, the margin of error for even those stocks is razor thin, as evidenced by the crumbling share price of former darlings like Netflix and Facebook.

(Use our stock finder tool to find an ETF’s allocation to a certain stock.)

A clearer picture of what’s in store for stocks will emerge in the next few weeks as more companies report earnings and we find out whether the S&P 500 can hold this crucial area it finds itself in.

435,2022-04-26T22:21:57+00:00,Stock market news live updates: Stock futures open mixed after tech-led rout,"U.S. stock futures opened mixed Tuesday evening after the major equity indexes slid during the regular trading day, as concerns over inflation and global economic growth stirred up further volatility across risk assets.

Contracts on the S&P 500 dipped. The index dropped 2.8% on Tuesday for its largest decline in seven weeks, with technology shares especially slammed. The Nasdaq Composite sank 4% to fall to 12,490.74 — its lowest level since December 2020. With just three trading days left in April, the S&P 500 is tracking toward a monthly decline of 7.8%.

A tepid quarterly earnings season pressed on, and the Big Tech companies that reported earnings after market close on Tuesday produced mixed results. Microsoft shares rose more than 5% in late trading after the company posted sales and earnings that exceeded estimates, fueled in part by further growth at its Azure cloud computing business. Alphabet, however, saw shares fall after posting a sharp deceleration in YouTube ad sales growth and missing on earnings, even as company-wide revenue came in-line with estimates. Peer ad-driven tech giant Meta Platforms is poised to report results Wednesday after market close.

The sell-off across U.S. stocks on Tuesday extended volatility seen so far in April and for the year-to-date, with investors continuing to monitor signs of elevated inflation and the further specter of supply chain strain as China grapples with an ongoing COVID-19 resurgence in key regions. And though the Federal Reserve is in a blackout period ahead of the central bank's May meeting next week, investors have still kept prospects of tightening monetary policy at the top of their minds, with higher rates and borrowing costs poised to pressure high-growth company valuations.

""The wall of worry has been building, as it relates to Fed worries,"" Matt Stucky, Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management senior portfolio strategist, told Yahoo Finance Live on Tuesday. ""Just a little over three months ago, the futures market was pricing in just three or four interest rate hikes for all of 2022. We're quite a bit above that now. And markets are pricing in a federal funds policy rate at about 2.7% by year end. So that's a significant amount of ratcheting up of Fed tightening that's been building up throughout the year. And it's one of the major reasons why we've seen volatility kick up as well.""

Given these myriad concerns, other analysts suggested investors brace for more choppiness in the near-term.

""There are some names deeply discounted but I do think there's a little bit more to go on the discounts. So I would be cautious about entering the markets at this point,"" Kathy Entwistle, Morgan Stanley Private Wealth Management managing director, told Yahoo Finance Live. ""It's impossible to call the bottom, so we do like to do a little bit of dollar cost averaging on the way in as well.""

""Supply chain has been an issue, we've had issues over in China, we've got inflation — these are all things we've known about and have been recurring,"" she added. ""But I think it's all coming to a head right now and everybody's at this point where it's like there's nowhere else to go. We know that [Fed] action is finally going to happen and that's going to affect the markets.""

436,2022-04-26T17:58:18+00:00,"Alphabet Q1 preview: Google search, YouTube ad growth in focus with Big Tech shares pressured","Google's parent company Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) is set to report first-quarter earnings results after market close on Tuesday, with investors looking for resilience in search and YouTube ad revenue in the wake of a slide in Big Tech stocks this year.

Here are the main metrics Alphabet is expected to report, based on consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg:

Revenue, excluding traffic-acquisition costs: $56.66 billion expected, $45.60 billion Y/Y Earnings per share: $25.71 vs. $21.46 Y/Y

Focus in Alphabet's latest quarterly report will center on the strength of its core search advertising business. This unit has been boosted over the past year as mobility ramped back up and businesses increased their marketing spend. However, that pickup last year has also created tougher comparisons for Alphabet to exceed this year in its top-line results, and rising expenses from heightened labor costs are expected to pressure the company's profitability .

""We do acknowledge risks to the downside given macroeconomic challenges, partly reflecting Russia/Ukraine events, as well as margin pressures related to inflationary pressures/wage growth,"" Angelo Zino, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, wrote in a note published last week. ""Comparisons do get more challenging as we progress through the calendar year (we see sales growth of 23% in Q1, decelerating to 15% by Q4), but Y/Y operating expense increases are seen being most intense in the first half.""

Based on Bloomberg consensus data, Google Search ad sales alone are expected to rise 23% to reach $39.1 billion, slowing from a 30% growth rate in the same quarter last year. And a similar trend is likely for YouTube's ad business, which is also expected to post a deceleration in sales growth. Analysts are looking for a 23% increase in YouTube's ad business to bring sales to about $7.4 billion, with this rise slowing from an almost 49% gain for the first quarter of 2021.

""Alphabet benefited from ad revenue growth coming out of the pandemic, but questions remain about the rate of future growth,"" George Ball, chairman of Sanders Morris Harris, said in an email Tuesday morning. ""There is also uncertainty about governmental and regulatory crackdowns on Alphabet, which can limit further stock growth. Alphabet is a great company, but is facing a new set of worries that didn't exist even a few years ago.""

For YouTube specifically, increased competition from social media companies and a bevy of new streaming platforms has further created risks to future growth. In a note published ahead of Tuesday's earnings results, a Cowen survey found that ByteDance-owned TikTok has been picking up share from YouTube among 18- to 24-year-olds.

""YouTube led all platforms in 1Q22 when respondents were asked which platform they used 'most often' for mobile video, but YouTube dropped to 35% of respondents vs. 45% in 1Q21, while TikTok was #2 with 22%,"" John Blackledge, a Cowen analyst, wrote in a note.

Still, Alphabet has been expanding its efforts in the cloud to offset slowing growth elsewhere. Google Cloud, while still smaller than incumbents like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, has been growing quickly, but still remains unprofitable. The unit is expected to grow sales 43% for the first quarter to reach $5.8 billion and post an operating loss of $893 million.

Big Tech and other once high-flying growth stocks have been pressured so far this year amid prospects of higher interest rates from the Federal Reserve, which would raise borrowing costs and weigh on the valuations of those companies. Alphabet shares have fallen 15% year-to-date through Monday's close, while the S&P 500 has declined 10% over the same period.

This post will be updated with the results of Alphabet's first-quarter results Tuesday after market close. Check back for updates.

Video Transcript

JULIE HYMAN: Welcome back. Well, as the Federal Reserve continues to increase rates and inflation soars to new highs, there's no question it's affecting US companies. Joining us now to discuss this is Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Semenova, although it's not necessarily how you would expect it to be affected, Alex.

ALEXANDRA SEMENOVA: Yeah, well, the Federal Reserve's easy money policies have sent corporate America into a refi frenzy, and balance sheets are looking much better because of it. Over the past two years, US companies have taken advantage of near zero interest rates and all-time low bond yields that made money essentially free to borrow during the pandemic. They used these COVID era financial conditions to refinance their debt, just as borrowing costs are set to increase with higher interest rates.

According to new data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, the median interest coverage ratio for US companies stood at 8.1 at the end of 2021. That's even better than the pre-pandemic level of 6.1. The figure is a measure of a company's ability to repay its debts, calculated by dividing earnings before interest and taxes by the cost of its debt interest payments.

A ratio of 2 is generally the minimum acceptable amount for a company, and analysts typically prefer a coverage ratio of 3 or higher. Companies have been using healthy market conditions to lock in good rates, and now their balance sheets are looking much better because of it, as the cost of debt is set to increase.

BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, really, it's, this, I think, goes lost on a lot of investors where rates go up and impacts their bottom line, really, in a material way. But you flagged Adam Aron over at AMC. What's up with that?

ALEXANDRA SEMENOVA: Well, that's definitely an interesting company to watch. As you guys remember in the beginning of the year, he said that one of AMC's New Year's resolutions was to refinance some of the very expensive debt that it has. So it'll be curious to see where they stand on that as borrowing costs increase.

Story continues

Because one thing to consider is that not only is it going to be more expensive to borrow new capital, but they have to look at the debt that is coming due, which is going to get a lot pricier. So we're going to see a pickup in companies who are either paying off that debt or refinancing to kind of take advantage of these pretty good market conditions that we're in right now before the Fed picks up rates.

JULIE HYMAN: And do we have a good feel for which companies are carrying the most debt and could be the most affected by all of this?

ALEXANDRA SEMENOVA: Well, there are many, you know. It's normal for corporate America to be borrowing some of these-- borrowing to kind of finance their operations and what they're doing. A few that come to mind are AT&T. I believe that it has debt coming due this quarter. A lot of big names, you know, looking at AMC, it's refinancing $5 billion in debt this quarter. So it'll be interesting to see the progress on some of these big names.

BRIAN SOZZI: Indeed it will. Alexandra Semenova, good to see you.

441,2022-04-25T11:14:43+00:00,"Stock market news live updates: Stock futures fall amid China's COVID restrictions, packed earnings week","U.S. stock futures declined Monday morning following global equities lower, as concerns over an escalating COVID outbreak in China added to jitters over U.S. economic growth in the face of heightened inflation and monetary policy tightening.

Contracts on the S&P 500 fell by nearly 1% ahead of the opening bell, as the index looked to add to last week's losses. The Dow and Nasdaq each also headed for lower opens. U.S. Treasury yields dropped, and the benchmark 10-year yield hovered just above 1.8%.

West Texas intermediate crude oil futures fell more than 4% to trade below $98 per barrel, with fears over the economic impact of broadening virus-related restrictions throughout China mounting. Beijing saw a spike in COVID cases over the weekend that prompted more mandatory testing and some lockdowns in the region. And this came as other populous cities including Shanghai have also recently grappled with fresh waves of infections, even as the country works to abolish the virus under a zero-COVID policy.

In a note published last week, Bank of America economist Helen Qiao slashed her forecast for China's gross domestic product (GDP) growth to 4.2% from 4.8% for 2022 as the number of lockdowns throughout the country increased.

""COVID-19 lockdowns and restrictions imposed in Shanghai and neighboring cities are not only hitting local demand but also causing logistic breakdowns and widespread supply-chain disruptions within and outside of the area,"" Qiao wrote in the note published April 19. ""In our view, even if such control measures will ultimately be rolled back and economic activities will gradually normalize by mid-year, a heavy toll on growth already seems inevitable.""

Meanwhile, investors have also been grappling with reassertions from Federal Reserve officials last week that the central bank would be taking a tough stance on reining in inflation. Fed Chair Jerome Powell as well as San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly were among the latest to suggest they saw the case for 50 basis point interest rate hikes this year. These larger-than-typical increases would front-load the Fed's monetary policy response to inflation in the near-term.

Story continues

""Mr. Powell once again highlighted the Fed’s focus on elevated prices and the need for policy to move towards neutral to restore price stability. His comments pretty much confirm market expectations of a 50-basis-point hike at the May 3-4 FOMC meeting, which would be the first such move since 2000,"" Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics, wrote in a note. ""While Mr. Powell did not comment on the trajectory of policy beyond the May FOMC meeting, other Fed officials — including San Francisco President Daly and Chicago President Evans — have said that a couple of 50-basis-point hikes are possible this year.""

Though Federal Reserve officials are in a quiet period this week ahead of the central bank's meeting next week, a packed slate of corporate earnings results will pull investors' attention. In the coming days, a bevy of major companies and stock index components will post results, including Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (FB), Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN).

As of Friday, about one-fifth of S&P 500 companies had reported their actual first-quarter results. Of these, 79% topped Wall Street's earnings estimates, while 69% exceeded sales expectations, according to data from FactSet's senior earnings analyst John Butters. The expected earnings growth rate for the index stood at 6.6% heading into this week, which if carried through the end of reporting season, would mark the slowest growth rate since the fourth quarter of 2020, Butters noted.

7:13 a.m. ET: Coca-Cola tops 1Q expectations

Coca-Cola (KO) reported first-quarter sales and profit that topped Wall Street's estimates, with broad growth across the beverage giant's portfolio of brands helping lift results.

Adjusted operating revenue grew 16% over last year to reach $10.5 billion, topping consensus expectations for $9.8 billion, according to Bloomberg data. Company-wide unit case volume — a closely watched measure for Coca-Cola — rose 8%, with growth coming most prominently from the company's nutrition, juice, dairy and plant-based beverages segment, where unit case volume increased 12%. On the bottom line, comparable earnings per share reached 64 cents versus the 58 cents expected.

For the full year, Coca-Cola said it expects its to see commodity price inflation be in the mid-single digit percentages. It also expected the suspension of its business in Russia to generate a 1% impact to full-year unit case volume, and a 1-2% impact on net revenues and operating income.

Video Transcript

[MUSIC PLAYING]

JULIE HYMAN: There are some early signs and signals that the Fed's plan might be working to combat record-high inflation and other recession risks by way of the job market. Now joining us to explain is the editor at TKer.co. That is our friend Sam Ro.

Sam, morning. It's good to see you. So the job market is sort of the vehicle here, or one of the vehicles by which the Fed can slow growth and thereby slow inflation. Where are you looking in there to see if there might be some signs that it's working?

SAM RO: So one of the metrics that Jerome Powell has been pointing to is job openings in the US labor market, and specifically, how job openings have been far outpacing the number of unemployed workers in the US economy. And so one of his-- one of the things that he's mentioned is that because of this disconnect, it's basically been giving a whole lot of leverage for workers to be asking for more money. And it's also put pressure on a lot of employers to increase pay in order to get those people into those job openings.

So part of the-- one of the efforts, when it comes to tightening monetary policy, is to try to get those job openings down in an effort to relieve some of that wage pressure, which, in turn, has been feeding into inflation. And so official job openings stat actually comes on about a two-month lag. The latest that we have, you know, is from February. And we're not gonna get the March job opening-- official March job openings data until early May.

However, the job listings site Indeed regularly publishes their own job openings metrics. And, you know, they cover a whole bunch of different industries. So they give you a relatively decent proxy for what to expect with job openings.

And through April-- I believe it was April 15 or April 16, mid-April, they've noticed that the number of job openings have actually been coming down for a couple of weeks. So that may be a sign that, whether it has anything to do with tighter monetary policy, what Jerome Powell is looking for in the labor market may already be beginning to happen.

Story continues

BRIAN SOZZI: Sam, is Jerome Powell-- do you think he is setting the table for a sharp job market slowdown later this year, or is it, you know, things just gradually cool off?

SAM RO: I think there's some nuance to exactly what that question is and what they're looking for, right? It could be the case that there continues to be job creation, you know, month after month after month. What he's looking for is to cool the labor market in terms of just the excess amount of demand that exists on the employer side.

So if we have-- I'm just throwing out a random hypothetical number here-- if we continue to have 300,000 jobs created month after month for the rest of the year, it could be possible that that occurs under conditions where there isn't a whole lot of inflation pressure if the supply and demand in the labor market is a little bit more even. Because there's so much demand for labor right now, because there is so many job openings, you know, think of it from the perspective of the prospective employee, right?

Like, let's say, for instance, I'm applying for a job. Well, if I have three different companies telling me that they want to hire me, then suddenly, I can get into this sort of bidding war in terms of pitting all these employers against each other so I get higher pay. But if I'm applying to one job, and I'm just having this unilateral conversation with them in terms of pay, I don't have a whole lot of leverage. So maybe that is what comes into play when, you know, those wage negotiations happen. I might still get a job, but there may be less pressure in terms of wages during those sort of interactions.

JULIE HYMAN: And what's interesting in all of this is, you know, you have all of these high estimates for how much the Fed is going to raise rates at each meeting and overall. And I wonder, if we continue to see the sort of number of job openings back off a little bit, what that does to that scenario. I guess if it-- at the same time, you still have hot inflation. It doesn't change the Fed's trajectory.

SAM RO: Yeah, so the Fed is really, really trying to thread a needle that is sort of really tough to wrap your head around, because as long as you have these excess job openings, it seems to be the case that there's gonna be a lot of pressure in terms of inflation. But the Fed also wants to stop short of cutting so deep, all the way to the bone, that you suddenly get to the point where there's so many jobs taken off of the market that you begin to cut into the labor force and companies start laying off employees.

So who knows exactly how that unfolds? You know, it's basically like trying to-- the way I see it, it's kind of like trying to land an aircraft on an aircraft carrier. Maybe it's possible, but it's just a lot more complicated and a lot more precision required than sort of what happens in a normal economy.

JULIE HYMAN: All right. And, Sam, I just want to mention also we just got the PMI numbers from S&P Global. And it's some interesting stuff that we're seeing in these numbers, because on the one hand, manufacturing is a little hotter than estimated, 59.7 here versus the 58 that was estimated-- services, though, weaker than estimated, 54.7 versus the 58 that was estimated. So that means the composite is lower than estimated at 55.1 versus the 57.9 that was estimated.

So overall, seeing manufacturing hotter and services weaker is really interesting because we've been waiting for that shift. All of that said, above 50s expansion, so all of this is still expanding. And these are the April preliminary numbers. So we could see revisions.

But there is a measure of price that's in here. And that price, that measure went to a record for both manufacturing and service providers. So again here, that sort of speaks to what you're talking about that price is still gonna be an issue going forward for us and for the Fed.

SAM RO: Right, yeah. And you just mentioned that, you know, because it's above 50, you still have growth in both the services sector and the manufacturing sector. So maybe what the Fed is trying to look for is a number of that probably comes closer to that sort of 50 level, where you're still growing, but not quite as hot-- not so hot that it's forcing prices to continue to increase.

Now, something that we're not really talking about is what happens with supply chains. I'm sure-- I haven't looked at the report yet, but I'm sure if you look at the report, they're gonna continue to have manufacturers and companies complaining about supply chain issues, which is forcing prices to continue going up. There could be some sort of miracle that happens at some point in this year where supply chains loosen up.

And it's no longer about having to cut the job openings, but maybe a lot of those job openings that we were talking about slowly get filled. And that really is sort of at the core of what's going on in terms of inflation, right? The real problem is we have all this demand, which is a great high-quality problem. But the supply chain is just not able to keep up.

So maybe there is a scenario where everything continues to grow in such a way that has been causing all this inflation, but perhaps supply chains do eventually loosen up, and we do get some relief in prices.

444,2022-04-21T16:45:00+00:00,"United Airlines Stock Soars, Affecting 127 ETFs","United Airlines stock was up more than 12% before noon on Thursday in the wake of its earnings release yesterday.

While the company recorded a $1.4 billion loss, translating into a $4.24 per share loss for the first quarter, its revenue was more than twice what it notched a year ago. The company also expects the rest of 2022 to be profitable due to spiking demand.

That and the recent lifting of airline mask mandates have generated enough enthusiasm for investors to bet big on the airline’s performance going forward. That boost in share price will no doubt affect the 127 ETFs that, in aggregate, hold 38.4 million shares, according to ETF.com’s Stock Finder tool. At current share prices, that translates into roughly $2 billion, or 11.7% of the company’s total market capitalization.

Unsurprisingly, the $3.4 billion U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS)has the largest allocation to United Airlines of any U.S.-listed ETF, which includes the stock as the second-largest holding in its portfolio, with a weight of 11.28%.

JETS also holds more shares of UAL than any other ETF, with 8.69 million, or nearly 23% of the total shares held in ETFs. The airline-focused ETF is followed by two more travel-related ETFs, the SonicShares Airlines, Hotels, Cruise Lines ETF (TRYP) and the Defiance Hotel, Airline, and Cruise ETF (CRUZ), which have allocations to the stock of 3.99% and 3.12%, respectively.

Beyond JETS, the largest ETFs own the most shares of UAL. The $400.7 billion SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) has a weighting in the stock of just .04% but holds 3.45 million shares. It’s followed by the $318.6 billion iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV), which holds 2.81 million shares, translating into a .04% weighting.

Roughly one-third of the ETFs holding UAL (41 funds) are classified as plain vanilla, cap-weighted ETFs. Thirteen actively managed ETFs hold the stock, while 13 value funds hold it as well. Another 10 can be categorized as ESG ETFs.

The stock’s rapid rise suggests that investors expect the travel industry to return to normal as the pandemic continues its slow fade from the public eye.

446,2022-04-20T18:28:08+00:00,"Jobless claims preview: Another 180,000 Americans likely filed new claims","Weekly unemployment claims are expected to hold near their lowest levels since the 1960s, with a strong labor market and improving levels of unemployment remaining a bright spot in the U.S. economy.

The Labor Department is set to release its latest weekly jobless claims report Thursday at 8:30 a.m. ET. Here are the main metrics expected from the print compared to consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg:

Initial jobless claims, week ended April 16: 180,000 expected, 185,000 during prior week Continuing claims, week ended April 9: 1.459 million expected, 1.475 million during prior week

First-time filings for unemployment benefits are expected to hold below 200,000 for a ninth consecutive week. As of early April, the four-week moving average for new jobless claims, which smooths out volatility in the weekly data, stood at just 172,250. Throughout 2019 before the pandemic, new claims averaged about 218,000 per week. And last month, jobless claims reached their lowest level since 1968 at 166,000.

Continuing claims, which tally the number of Americans collecting benefits for multiple weeks, have also declined sharply to reach multi-decade lows. These came in below 1.5 million for the first time since 1970 in last week's report.

The weekly jobless claims data have served as an ongoing reminder of the tightness in the current labor market. Job openings have far outpaced new hires — a phenomenon many companies this quarterly earnings season have been quick to acknowledge.

""Transportation and labor markets remain tight,"" Andre Schulten, Procter & Gamble chief financial officer, said during the company's earnings call Wednesday morning. ""Labor availability is certainly a stretch, not for P&G directly, but more for our supplier base.""

Companies in other industries have also highlighted these concerns. Bank of America CFO Alastair Borthwick said during the firm's earnings calls earlier this week that the bank's clients ""are definitely seeing supply chain challenges"" that have extended to the workforce.

Story continues

""We've also seen inflation, and we're seeing labor and wage pressure,"" Borthwick said.

And rising labor costs as companies compete for talent could ultimately exert even further pressure on corporate profit margins.

""For companies, labor costs, which account for roughly 70% of total costs, are far more important that materials costs,"" Rubeela Farooqi, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, wrote in a note Tuesday. ""While wage gains are not keeping up with price increases, building cost pressures are a risk for company bottom lines.""

""Before-tax corporate profits rose 25% year-over-year in Q4 2021 after 27% in Q3 and 69% in Q2. But with the Fed moving to dampen demand, how long will businesses be able to pass on increasing cost?"" she added. ""The silver lining may come from a rebalancing of labor supply and demand, which could provide relief to businesses on wages going forward.""

This post will be updated with the results of the Labor Department's weekly jobless claims report Thursday at 8:30 a.m. ET. Check back for updates.

The overall market mood is risk averse, influenced by the macroeconomic uncertainty and intensification of geopolitical tensions. Biopharma stocks are historically considered defensives since their fortunes are very loosely tied to external factors.

This safe-haven appeal could position these companies in good stead in the near term, given the prospect of steady returns even in the face of market upheavals.

The biotech sector has underperformed over the past year, giving back the gains it notched up following the outbreak of Covid-19 in early 2020. The SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (NYSE:XBI) has lost about 37% since mid-April 2021 as opposed to the roughly 8% gain for the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY). The sector per se is undervalued vis-à-vis the broader market.

What would it take for the sector to rediscover its mojo? Breakthrough innovation, a pickup in deal flow, successes in clinical trials, hassle-free regulatory pathways and removal of regulatory overhang can go a long way in restoring investor confidence in the sector.

Undervalued Biotech Stocks: Arcus Biosciences (RCUS) Image of two scientists in lab coats studying results in a lab

Hayward, California-based Arcus is a clinical-stage, cancer-focused biopharma that has a broad portfolio of small molecules, enabling differentiated combination therapies. It has two late-stage investigational assets and a host of mid-stage compounds in its pipeline.

The company has a long-standing collaboration with GileadSciences (NASDAQ:GILD) for developing cancer immunotherapies. Arcus would receive a $725 million payment from Gilead following the latter opting to exercise options for three small molecules. Gilead will also share costs as the two companies co-develop these molecules.

Also, Arcus is partnering with AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) for developing a combo therapy for lung cancer.

The second half of the year is a catalyst-rich one for the biotech, with several clinical readouts scheduled for the period.

Arcus stock is down over 20% in the year-to-date. Analysts, on average, expect it to more than double from the current levels.

Vir Biotechnology calls itself a company that combines “immunologic insights and cutting-edge technologies” to treat and prevent infectious diseases. The San Francisco-based company was in the spotlight during the Covid outbreak, as it teamed up with GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) to develop monoclonal antibody treatments, VIR-7831 and VIR-7832.

The former, marketed as Sotrovimab, has already been authorized by the Food and Drug Administration for treating mild-to-moderate Covid-19. The company is evaluating an intramuscular version for the same indication and is also testing it in hospitalized Covid patients as well as a prophylactic option.

Aside of its Covid portfolio, Vir is evaluating small interfering RNA molecules as monotherapy and combo treatment for hepatitis B virus. It is also developing an antibody treatment candidate as prophylactic treatment for influenza A and a T-cell vaccine candidate for HIV.

7 High-Quality Dividend Stocks With High Yields

Since the start of the year, the stock has lost almost half of its market value, partly reflecting skepticism over the extent to which Vir’s Covid portfolio can support its valuation.

Sell-side analysts are uber-bullish on this beaten-down biotech and project nearly 250% upside from current levels.

This once-obscure German biopharma shot to the spotlight with its mRNA technology that came in handy for the expeditious development of Covid-19 vaccine when the pandemic struck in 2020. Along with collaboration partner Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), BioNTech struck gold with its Covid-19 vaccine, named Comirnaty.

BioNTech’s share of Comirnaty revenue topped $20 billion in 2021 and it expects to rake in another $14 billion to $18 billion revenue in 2022.

The stock has declined about 40% since the start of the year amid the market-wide pessimism and fears over the sustainability of Covid vaccine revenue growth.

To be sure, BioNTech isn’t a one-trick pony. It has a rich pipeline targeting infectious diseases and cancer. Particularly for cancer, the company has tie-ups with Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY) and Roche’s (OTC:RHHY) Genentech unit.

The average analysts’ price target of $243.80 suggests that the stock offers upside potential of about 54%.

Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Beam is a platform technology company developing precision genetic medicines. Its proprietary base-editing technology enables precise, predictable and efficient single-base changes, at targeted genomic sequences.

Beam’s pipeline candidates have yet to enter clinics. Three investigational new drug-enabling studies are ongoing for indications such as sickle cell disease, beta thalassemia and certain type of blood cancers.

The company has a multi-target R&D collaboration with Pfizer for in-vivo base-editing programs for a range of rare diseases. The partnership could fetch the company up to $1.35 billion in upfront and milestone payments.

The stock is down about 41% year-to-date, but could advance by about 150%, based on the average analysts’ price target of $113.57.

Wednesday, April 20, 2022

Today's newsletter is by Brian Cheung, an anchor and reporter covering the Fed, economics, and banking for Yahoo Finance. You can follow him on Twitter @bcheungz.

Americans are not the only ones feeling the pain of high inflation. It’s bogging down almost every other nation as well.

A fresh round of economic forecasts from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Tuesday lowered global growth prospects, in part because of rising price pressures. Making matters worse: the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

“Inflation is a clear and present danger for many economies,” IMF Chief Economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas told Yahoo Finance Tuesday. In January, the IMF projected global growth of 4.4% in 2022. Yesterday’s update downgraded that forecast to 3.6%.

Globally, the IMF predicts that prices in “advanced economies” (like the U.S.) will rise by 5.7% this year. In emerging market and developing economies, inflation is projected to clock in at 8.7% this year.

Those figures make it clear that inflation is not a phenomenon exclusive to the U.S., where Consumer Price Index readings from March showed prices rising by 8.5% year-over-year.

The IMF warns that these pressures will “remain elevated for longer” than it had originally expected earlier in the year, due to the disruption to energy and metal exports from Russia and wheat exports from Ukraine. A zero-COVID policy in China could scramble supply chains out of Asia as infections rise.

All of this means that central banks like the Federal Reserve will have to deliver the medicine of higher borrowing costs to tamp down on inflation. In the U.S., Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is on the warpath against higher interest rates, with all signs pointing to a king-sized interest rate increase of 0.50% next month (not done since 2000).

Story continues

The Bank of England is a few steps ahead of the Fed on tightening, and the European Central Bank appears poised to follow soon.

The problem: the cure could be worse than the disease. Pull the crisis-era stimulus too fast, and the central banks could tip the economy into recession (see: yield curve inversion).

“This is certainly a serious downside risk,” Gourinchas said Tuesday, adding that central banks need to be careful as they walk that “fine line.”

Either way, the outcome is going to be the same.

Raise rates and lower inflation? Higher borrowing costs lowers consumption… and leads to slower growth.

Move too slow and inflation runs rampant? High prices erase wage gains and lowers consumption… and leads to slower growth.

451,2022-04-19T14:30:00+00:00,Dollar ETFs Among The Rare Winners From Rising Rates,"Surging interest rates have been a drag on most ETFs this year. You can draw a direct link between the rise in rates and the weakness seen in popular ETF categories, like bond ETFs and high-growth stock ETFs.

But not every ETF is suffering from higher interest rates. Funds tied to the U.S. dollar have actually benefited from the increase in rates. The $1 billion Invesco DB U.S. Dollar Index Bullish Fund (UUP) is up 5% this year, while the $440 million WisdomTree Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Bullish Fund (USDU) is up 3.5%.

Higher rates make the U.S. dollar relatively more attractive compared to foreign currencies. That pushes capital into dollar assets, lifting the greenback’s exchange rate versus its peers. The positive correlation between rates and the dollar doesn’t always hold—especially over long periods of time, when purchasing power and inflation are bigger factors—but it can be a dominant driver over shorter time periods.

The U.S. Dollar Index, one of the most widely followed gauges of the dollar’s value and the index underlying UUP, recently topped 100 for the first time in two years. The index—which measures the value of the dollar against the euro, yen, pound, Canadian dollar, krona and franc—has been hovering in range between 88 and 103 since 2015:

The Bloomberg Dollar Index, which underlies USDU, tracks a broader basket of10n currencies—including the Chinese renminbi and the Indian rupee—shows a similar pattern, though it’s not quite back to its highs from 2020:

UUP’s greater exposure to the USD/EUR exchange rate has served it well this year as the euro has fallen sharply against the buck. The ETF’s lack of exposure to certain emerging market currencies, like the renminbi and rupee—which have held up pretty well against the greenback recently—has also helped it outperform.

Keep An Eye On The Range

Investors will be closely watching to see whether the dollar holds within its seven-year range or if it has enough juice to break out to new heights.

Story continues

The most plausible bull case for the greenback rests on inflation staying elevated, pushing the Fed to respond by hiking rates much more aggressively than expected. Any black swan events that spur a flight to safety should also benefit the buck.

On the other hand, if inflation cools off quickly and the Fed doesn’t have to hike rates as high as the market expects, that could stop the dollar rally in its tracks.

Currency Hedging

The aforementioned currency ETFs are those most directly affected by the dollar’s movements, but other funds are impacted as well—just in a more indirect way. One area where movements in the dollar play a big part is with international equities. Anyone invested in foreign stocks is making at least a tacit bet on currency movements.

For example, the returns for a vanilla, unhedged position in German stocks in a U.S. investor’s portfolio will be influenced both by the performance of the underlying equities and the performance of the euro against the U.S. dollar.

Investors can hedge that risk with a plethora of currency-hedged ETFs available on the market, including the Xtrackers MSCI EAFE Hedged Equity ETF (DBEF), the WisdomTree Japan Hedged Equity Fund (DXJ), the WisdomTree Europe Hedged Equity Fund (HEDJ) and the iShares Currency Hedged MSCI EAFE ETF (HEFA).

Currency-hedged products tend to outperform their vanilla counterparts when the dollar is rising (and vice versa).

Keep in mind that it doesn’t always make sense to hedge currency risk, even when you have a strong view on a particular currency. In some cases, the cost to hedge is prohibitively expensive, such as when hedging currencies with high interest rates (e.g., emerging market currencies).

Multinationals Benefit

Even for investors who aren’t interested in speculating directly on foreign exchange rates, currencies still have an impact. That doesn’t necessarily mean investors have to make dramatic moves to their portfolios in response to fluctuations in currencies, but they should understand how such movements may affect their returns.

For instance, a stronger dollar makes U.S. exporters less competitive and reduces the profits of multinational companies that conduct a lot of their business overseas.

Similarly, small cap stocks, such as those held in the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM), tend to have less overseas exposure than the large cap stocks held in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY). That hasn’t really helped IWM this year—it’s underperforming SPY—but it could if the dollar becomes a bigger factor.

Tuesday, April 19, 2022

Today's newsletter is by Emily McCormick, a reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow her on Twitter

Everybody’s talking about a recession that may not come — anytime soon.

Calls for a downturn have escalated in recent months amid soaring inflation, inverted Treasury yield curves, and the specter of tighter monetary policy from the Federal Reserve. Goldman Sachs economists said they place the odds of a recession in the next year at 15%, and in the next two years at a more worrying 35%. A recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth in a country's gross domestic product (GDP).

And it’s not just the Wall Street banks. Google searches in the U.S. for “how to prepare for a recession” nearly tripled over the past week alone, said Neil Dutta, head of economics at Renaissance Macro Research, citing Google Trends data. However, this spike in interest may actually be a sign that concerns of a recession are reaching an apex.

“Indeed, when the sell-side consensus is competing to see who can pencil in rising recession probabilities fastest and ordinary people are searching about these topics on the internet, you can be sure the news is already reflected in market prices,” Dutta said in a note Monday. “The next move is lower recession risk and slower inflation rates.”

What’s particularly “unusual” about recession talk this time around, Dutta added, is how disconnected it is from the strength in economic data. Many of the most recent U.S. reports have painted a picture of an economy still firing on all cylinders, even as inflation runs at its fastest rate in 40 years. In the labor market, non-farm payrolls have increased by an average of over 550,000 per month in the first quarter this year, following average growth of more than 600,000 per month in the fourth quarter.

Story continues

“That’s barely consistent with a slowdown, let alone a recession,” Dutta said.

And even consumer sentiment, which has been weighed down this year by rising prices, has shown signs of recovering from a nadir. The University of Michigan’s closely watched Surveys of Consumers index unexpectedly rose to 65.7 in early April, which while still depressed compared to pre-pandemic levels, was up nearly 11%, compared to the prior month’s more than 10-year low. Calls for a recession among Wall Street pundits have ramped up in recent weeks.

Some other strategists also suggested the lingering cushion of consumer savings and still-resilient spending would help prop up the U.S. economy.

“I would say it's probably closer to a coin toss that the economy will be moving into recession by the end of the year,” Vincent Reinhart, Dreyfus and Mellon chief economist and macro strategist, told Yahoo Finance Live.

“By some measures, households have in the neighborhood of $2 trillion of excess savings. They can start working [those] savings down — and they are,” he added. “And that will be an important buffer.”

Still, those calling for a near-term recession have drawn on a host of historically reliable indicators that have been already flashing red. As Goldman Sachs’ economists pointed out, 11 out of the 14 Fed tightening cycles since World War II have been followed by a recession within two years. And the Fed this year has already begun raising interest rates and signaling its intent to soon begin quantitative tightening (QT), or rolling assets off its $9 trillion balance sheet.

Economists at Deutsche Bank, the first major Wall Street bank to call for a U.S. recession next year, said it is “The more aggressive tightening of monetary policy that we envision will end up pushing the economy into a recession,” according to a note from the firm’s economist Brett Ryan.

“While timing the exact quarters of negative growth is never easy, we see the Fed’s tightening beginning to materially slow growth in the second half of 2023,” Ryan said in a note last week. “Our baseline forecast has negative quarters for growth in Q4 2023 and Q1 2024, consistent with a recession during that time.”

Plus, a key part of the U.S. Treasury yield curve has already inverted, with the yield on the 2-year note rising above that on the 10-year note earlier this month. Such an inversion came before each of the last eight recessions since 1969. But as many pundits pointed out, that occurrence says little about exactly how soon to brace for the downturn to begin.

“I’m going to go in the ‘no recession’ camp for this year,” Michael Antonelli, managing director and market strategist at Baird, told Yahoo Finance Live on Monday. “If you use the yield curve inversion as your signal, which we all know it’s a pretty good signal, the shortest a yield curve has led to a recession is 6 months, that was back in COVID, the longest was 33 months … the average is 17 months.”

“Unless you think the recession’s going to come faster than it did for COVID, it’s somewhere out in 2023, possibly in 2024,” he added. “Right now, companies are hiring, businesses are expanding, people are working and spending money … I don’t think it’s imminent right now.”

453,2022-04-19T10:14:06+00:00,Goldman Sachs thinks these are the best stocks to buy right now,"Investors should lean toward owning stable stocks amid the increasingly volatile economic backdrop and hope for the best, fancies Goldman Sachs.

Goldman strategist Ben Snider said in a new note Tuesday that stable stocks — or ones that sport low share price and earnings growth volatility — are a must-own in this current moment. The strategist said the investment bank's basket of stable growth stocks has outperformed the S&P 500 by five percentage points during the past six months as economic risks such as rising inflation have risen.

These types of stocks ""appear to have room to run,"" said Snider.

The valuations on these stable stocks look attractive, too.

Snider added, ""Stable stocks also trade with undemanding valuations, supporting the likelihood that they will outperform if the macro environment grows increasingly challenging. Stocks with stable share prices and stable earnings growth generally trade with a valuation premium relative to more volatile peers and to the typical S&P 500 stock. However, relative valuations today are much lower than they have generally been during the last few years.""

Snider's call comes against a backdrop of slowing economic growth, stubbornly high inflation and elevated geopolitical risk. That cocktail has Wall Street increasingly worried about a recession within the next two years.

""Our analysis of historical G10 episodes suggests that although strong economic momentum limits the risk in the near-term, the policy tightening we expect raises the odds of recession. As a result, we now see the odds of a recession as roughly 15% in the next 12 months and 35% within the next 24 months,"" said Jan Hatzius, Snider's colleague at Goldman, on Monday.

Earlier this month, Deutsche Bank's Matthew Luzzetti became the first economist from a major Wall Street firm to predict a U.S. recession. Others such as Goldman have since piled on.

The latest economic data sheds light on the recession calls.

Story continues

Inflation readings continue to run red-hot as the economy recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic and deals with soaring prices for energy. The Producer Price Index (PPI) for March recently showed a worrying 11.2% advance spanning the past 12 months.

Goldman's economists led by Hatzius expect annual average U.S. real GDP growth to slow from 6% in 2021 to 3% in 2022. The team sees 2% growth for 2023.

454,2022-04-18T13:52:59+00:00,"Market check: Stocks mixed at open, bitcoin sees 5-day drop","Yahoo Finance’s Jared Blikre breaks down how markets opened on Monday.

Video Transcript

- Let's get down to the floor of the New York Stock Exchange and check in with our very own Jared Blikre. And Jared, we're seeing some mixed action here to kick off this week of trading.

JARED BLIKRE: Yeah. It's kind of a little bit of deja vu, here. I came back last Tuesday. And I was talking about how the market had come back down to a very important level. Let's take a look at the S&P 500. Now, we are right back to last Tuesday and Wednesday levels.

On a longer time frame, now, let's take a look at a two-month chart here. Here's the previous five days trading action. You can see we're right back down here. Now, the reason this is important is this is a halfway back point, basically a 50% retracement of this move that we saw to the upside. This is where bull should re-enter.

So we're seeing the VVIX pick up a little bit. So that's a little bit of a risk, off tone to the markets right now. But it is Monday. And as I like to say, really, the market doesn't get started until Tuesday morning. You've got to watch the first hour of trading to kind of tap what the trend of the week is going to be.

Also taking a look at the bond market, not that much going on. Let's take a look at the five-year. I think it was down to one or two basis points. There you go. Ten-year, right up against multi-year highs as well. So we're keeping an eye on that.

Now, as much as we've been tracking the yield curve and how rising yields tend to benefit value stocks, haven't really seen that over the last few weeks so much. The bond market, the volatility, kind of leaking over into equities. Equities kind of stalling out here. Nevertheless, we're seeing more green than red today. NVIDIA looks like a standout of 1%.

Chinese stocks, I really don't have a lot to add to your conversation other than to say you thought it couldn't get worse for DIDI. It is now sub $2. Let's take a look, $1.94. Just taking a look at the year to date chart. That is a mess, guys. Down 61% from its IPO. Let's just calculate. It's down 86%. So the fallout from the Chinese stock just continues here.

Story continues

Now, taking a look at some of our leaders. We have Home Builders in the upper left. That's XHB. And also to SOX. That's the Philly chip index. Those are the leaders of the day.

To the downside, KWEB, that's a Chinese ETF. IPO, that's an IPO ETF. ARKK, we know what that is. Biotech, software, and emerging markets are the underperformers.

I like to get a sense of the travel market here. And we're seeing Carnival Cruise lines down 1%. Delta Airlines up about 1/4 of a percent. Not seeing a lot of action here, except for Trip.com which happens to be a Chinese stock, so explaining that story.

Finally, a look at the EV market here. And aside from some of these Chinese names, we are seeing a little bit of green in terms of Toyota Motors up 1 and 3/4 of a percent. Ford, just barely positive. But Tesla, the kahuna, trading under $1,000, down about 2/10 of a percent, guys.

- And one more asset class that we've been watching this morning, that we've been talking about is crypto. We are seeing Bitcoin sort of hold below 40,000. What are the charts telling you?

JARED BLIKRE: Yeah. Well, Bitcoin is at a pretty critical level itself right here. Here's a year to date look. And we are right back down to 38. 38,000 to 40,000 is kind of a big deal. And if this area doesn't hold, I think it'll be a quick trip down to that 30,000 support that we saw last year.

So here's a one-year chart. 28,000 to 30,000 is a level that we kind of crashed to after breaking to new nominal highs last year. So we'll have to see if this holds. So basically, the bottom line is, 38,000 goes, probably going to see 30,000 pretty quickly.

But if we climb above 40, get back above 45 again, probably back off to the races. I would expect to test those record highs and beyond.

- Thanks, Jared. Appreciate it.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/market-check-stocks-mixed-open-135259957.html,"['013A.F', '0700.HK', '9618.HK', '9988.HK', 'AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'AHLA.F', 'AHLA.XETRA', 'AMZ.F', 'AMZ.XETRA', 'AMZN.MX', 'AMZN.US', 'AMZO34.SA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA', 'BABA.US', 'BABA34.SA']",[],"{'polarity': 0.984, 'neg': 0.016, 'neu': 0.922, 'pos': 0.062}"
455,2022-04-18T10:18:32+00:00,There is a 35% chance of a recession in 2 years: Goldman Sachs,"With recession calls on Wall Street picking up as the Federal Reserve embarks on what could be up to eight interest rate hikes this year, Goldman Sachs no longer wants to be left out of the growing crowd.

""Our analysis of historical G10 episodes suggests that although strong economic momentum limits the risk in the near-term, the policy tightening we expect raises the odds of recession. As a result, we now see the odds of a recession as roughly 15% in the next 12 months and 35% within the next 24 months,"" said Jan Hatzius, Goldman Sachs chief economist, in a new note to clients.

Eleven out of 14 tightening cycles since World War II have been followed by a recession within two years, warns Hatzius.

Added Hatzius, ""Taken at face value, these historical patterns suggest the Fed faces a narrow path to a soft landing as it aims to close the jobs-workers gap and bring inflation back towards its 2% target.""

Earlier this month, Deutsche Bank's Matthew Luzzetti became the first economist from a major Wall Street firm to predict a U.S. recession. Others such as Goldman have since piled on.

The warnings come at a precarious time for the U.S. economy.

Inflation readings continue to run red-hot as the economy recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic and deals with soaring prices for energy. The Producer Price Index (PPI) for March recently showed a worrying 11.2% advancer spanning the past 12 months.

Consumer confidence has weakened amid the inflationary pressures, an element that showed up in a notable drop in online retail sales data for March.

Meanwhile, share prices of value-focused retailers such as Walmart and Costco have been on a strong stretch of gains in the last couple of weeks on fears of a consumer spending slowdown.

While the major stock indexes are still not pricing in a recession, pros are beginning to brace for that to happen very soon.

""So what you have is an enough tightening by the Federal Reserve to deal with inflation adequately, and that is too much tightening for the markets and the economy. So the Fed is going to be in a very difficult place a year from now as inflation still remains high and it starts to pinch on both the markets and the economy,"" Bridgewater Associates founder and co-chief investment Ray Dalio officer said in an interview for Yahoo Finance Presents. ""I think that most likely what we're going to have is a period of stagflation. And then you have to understand how to build a portfolio that's balanced for that kind of an environment.""

456,2022-04-17T15:41:31+00:00,"Netflix, Tesla earnings: What to know in markets this week","This week, earnings season is set to ramp up, offering investors a fresh set of data on the strength of corporate profits in the face of elevated inflationary pressure.

Two of the major names reporting this week will include Netflix (NFLX) and Tesla (TSLA), offering an early look at how some of the mega-cap technology companies performed in the early part of the year.

The other names set to report this week will span a range of industries, broadening out from last week's bank-dominated results. Companies including United Airlines (UAL), American Express (AXP), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Kimberly-Clark (KMB) are each on deck to report in the coming days.

For earnings season so far, results have been mixed, albeit heavily skewed toward the slew of financial names that reported last week including JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS). About 7% of S&P 500 index components have reported actual Q1 results so far, and 77% of these have topped Wall Street's earnings per share (EPS) estimates, matching the five-year average percentage, according to data from FactSet. The estimated earnings growth rate for the index currently stands at 5.1%, which if carried through the rest of the season would mark the lowest earnings growth rate for the index since the fourth quarter of 2020.

Netflix earnings

Netflix is set to report results on Tuesday, with investors closely watching for further signs of a slowdown in the streaming giant's growth after a pandemic-era surge in subscriber numbers.

Analysts' consensus estimates are looking for Netflix to have added about 2.51 million subscribers for the first quarter, which would mark the least since the second quarter of 2021. This would bring Netflix's total subscribers to just under 225 million. In the same quarter last year, subscribers grew by nearly 4 million.

Though Netflix has already seen subscriber growth slow sharply from a pandemic-era peak, the streaming giant's exit from Russia in early March is also set to further contribute to the deceleration. The Los Gatos, Calif.-based company suspended operations in Russia on March 6 over the country's invasion of Ukraine, and since then, analysts further trimmed their subscriber estimates.

Story continues

""We now expect paid net adds of 1.45MM, below guide of 2.5MM given Russia suspension (~1MM subs),"" Cowen analyst John Blackledge wrote in a note last week. The firm also lowered its price target on Netflix to $590 a share from $600 previously, on account of the lower subscriber growth forecast. BRAZIL - 2022/02/03: In this photo illustration, the Netflix logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen and in the background. (Photo Illustration by Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)

Other analysts also suggested that Netflix's churn, or subscriber losses, could increase in the quarter after the company announced a price increase for subscribers in the U.S. and Canada in January. But revenue pulled from these price increases could also be used to help Netflix build out bigger content slates and drive growth in less saturated markets internationally, others pointed out.

""Netflix appears to be nearing a ceiling on UCAN (U.S. and Canada) subscribers, and is pulling new levers to lower churn,"" Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter wrote in a note. ""Subscription price increases in the West should fuel additional content production and growth in other regions, and our bias is that cash flow will turn positive in 2022 and beyond, as management has guided. However, subscriber growth will likely occur primarily in less developed regions at lower subscription prices, with Western subscribers paying higher rates to fund new content.""

""Content dumps, where all episodes of a new season are delivered at the same instant, will likely keep churn high, as price conscious consumers can swap out of Netflix and shift to a competitor service after viewing the content they desire,"" he added. ""Sustainable profit growth should continue so long as Netflix is able to continue raising subscription prices, but competition may limit future price increases.""

Overall, Netflix is expected to report GAAP earnings of $2.91 per share on revenue of $7.95 billion, which on the top line would represent just a 11% increase over last year. In the same quarter in 2021, revenue grew 24%.

Shares of Netflix have fallen 43% for the year-to-date in 2022, underperforming against the S&P 500's 7.8% drop over that same period.

Tesla earnings

Meanwhile, another major company set to report results this week will be Tesla.

The electric vehicle maker is scheduled to post its quarterly report Wednesday after market close. Ahead of these results, Tesla announced record deliveries of more than 310,000 during the first three months of this year. That represented a 68% jump over last year's deliveries. Tesla has sought to average 50% growth in annual vehicle deliveries.

Production, however, slipped slightly on a quarter-over-quarter basis, with output coming in at 305,407 for the first quarter compared to 305,840 during the final three months of 2021. Tesla, like many other automakers, has continued to grapple with lingering supply chain challenges and rising input costs, leading CEO Elon Musk to suggest that the company may begin mining its own lithium for batteries as metal prices soar.

""Right now Tesla has a high-class problem of demand outstripping supply with this issue now translating into ~5-6 month delays for Model Ys, some Model 3s in different parts of the globe,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note. ""The key to alleviating these issues is centered around the key Giga openings in Austin and Berlin which will alleviate the bottlenecks of production for Tesla globally.""

Just earlier this month, Tesla officially began delivering its first Texas-made vehicles from its new Austin Gigafactory. At Tesla's ""Cyber Rodeo"" launch party on April 7, Musk said the facility was aiming to begin building the Tesla Cybertruck starting in 2023 and has targeted making 500,000 units of the Model Y per year.

The newly made U.S. Gigafactory is set to be pivotal in helping Tesla further ramp production and help meet demand domestically, especially given snarls internationally as Tesla's Shanghai Gigafactory closed for weeks due to a COVID outbreak in the region.

""We believe by the end of 2022 Tesla will have the run rate capacity for overall ~2 million units annually from roughly 1 million today,"" Ives added. ""While the China zero COVID policy is causing shutdowns in Shanghai for Tesla (and others) and remains a worrying trend if it continues, seeing the forest through the trees with Austin and Berlin now live and ramping, Musk & Co. will continue to flex its distribution muscles in the EV landscape while many other automakers struggle to get things off the ground.""

While Tesla shares have outperformed the S&P 500 for the year-to-date, the stock came under pressure on Thursday after Musk disclosed he made an offer to buy social media company Twitter (TWTR) for $54.20 per share, or about $43 billion in cash. Many have noted Musk would likely have to sell Tesla shares in order to finance the deal if it were to go through.

In Tesla's first-quarter results, Wall Street is looking for the company to post adjusted earnings of $2.27 per share on revenue of $17.85 billion, representing sales growth of 65%.

First quarter earnings are trickling in with mixed results.

JPMorgan Chase expressed a more cautious outlook on borrowers Wednesday and finished the day down 3.2% to its lowest level since January 2021, while Delta Air Line's surprisingly favorable travel forecast led to a 6.2% gain. But despite a potential sixth straight quarter of earnings growth, Wall Street analysts are cautioning for a potential growth scare for the balance of 2022 as sky-high earnings estimates return to Earth.

FactSet expects Q1 earnings of 4.7% for the S&P 500, which could easily top 10%, as companies tend to beat profit estimates more often than not. But a year ago, that number was 52.5%, and the quarter after it was an eye watering 91.1%. As these stimulus-fueled profits revert to historical norms, analysts may get caught behind the 8 ball — forced to revise their estimates lower as new economic realities set in.

Goldman Sachs' David Kostin wrote over the weekend that his team expects downside risks to earnings estimates for the remaining three quarters of 2022. He highlighted the perhaps misguided optimism among the current Street forecasts, saying, ""Full-year EPS estimates have actually been revised 2% higher since the start of the year and earnings growth is forecast to accelerate in coming quarters.""

Yet, economic uncertainty rules. Just prior to the current week's earnings, Kostin wrote, ""Analysts appear reluctant to adequately trim forecasts despite the high degree of uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook.""

JPMorgan didn't disappoint Kostin's narrative, as the bank increased its loan loss reserves more than expected — a slightly more conservative bet that there may be higher future defaults on loans. While CEO Jamie Dimon downplayed the move, an increasingly hawkish Federal Reserve (caught behind its own inflation 8 ball) and an unsettled war in Europe are giant tail risks.

But if these forecasts prove too Panglossian, passive investors may be in for a choppy 2022, while stock pickers will need laser-like precision to separate winners and losers.

All about energy and defense

Looking at what's worked so far this year in the S&P 500, energy is the big standout, up 43% in 2022 on surging oil and gas prices. Number two on the winners list is the utilities sector, up 6%, followed by consumer staples, up 2% — both traditionally defensive areas. The sectors housing growthier names — as well as the mega caps — are all off 10% or more. It's been an admittedly tough year for most investors.

Basically, it's been all energy and defense in 2022 with mostly disappointment everywhere else. And while energy is a traditional value play, so are the financials, which happen to be down 5% on the year. Why? U.S. Treasury yields have been screaming higher. This traditionally bodes well for banks, which try to borrow at low rates and lend at higher rates. But with investors pricing in an increasingly hawkish Fed — now expected to raise rates at double the pace each meeting — the short end of the curve is rising faster than the long end. This means bank profits are getting squeezed. S&P 500 Sector Performance — YTD

So what stocks should investors buy? Jared Woodard, head of ETF Strategy at BofA, on Yahoo Finance Live Wednesday outlined why the move in energy stocks still has room to run — as well as the broader set of resource and material stocks.

""[E]nergy and resources broadly used to account for 20% to 40% of the total value of the market. Looking back over American economic history, today, they account for less than 7% of that total,"" said Woodard, who goes on to explain the dynamics in play.

""[W]hether it's resource independence, decarbonization, [or] any of the big policy goals across the political spectrum that are gaining focus today, that these are going to require massive new investments in capacity, both for energy and for metals, and mining,"" he said.

Woodard points out that America's infrastructure plays — from EV buildouts to repairing dilapidated resources to nuclear power investment — all take more resources.

""[N]one of these investments have been made in the last five years, there's a huge catch up trade to be done here,"" he said. ""And we think that this is going to mark a secular shift with much more upside for both energy and for material [stocks].""

460,2022-04-13T17:40:45+00:00,"Jobless claims preview: Another 170,000 Americans likely filed new claims last week","U.S. jobless claims likely held near multi-decade lows last week as companies work to keep employees on their payrolls amid ongoing labor shortages.

The Labor Department is set to release its latest weekly jobless claims report Thursday at 8:30 a.m. ET. Here are the main metrics expected from the print, based on consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg:

Initial jobless claims, week ended April 9: 170,000 expected, 166,000 during prior week Continuing claims, week ended April 2: 1.500 million expected, 1.523 million during prior week

First-time unemployment claims fell to the lowest level since 1968 last week at just 166,000. That compares to the average of about 218,000 new claims filed per week throughout 2019 before the pandemic. And the latest figures represent a staggering reversal from the outsized claims filed at the height of the pandemic two years ago, when claims at one point topped 6.1 million in a single week in April 2020.

Given the surge and then decline in jobless claims, the Labor Department has also now reconfigured the way it adjusts the weekly data to account for seasonal factors. Starting last week, the Labor Department returned to using ""multiplicative"" seasonal adjustment factors for the data. For much of the pandemic, the department had been using ""additive"" seasonal adjustments that help smooth out large swings in the weekly numbers.

Nevertheless, the underlying trend in the claims data has undeniably pointed to a labor market still short of sufficient worker supply to meet demand. Labor costs have risen for companies across industries as a result, and contributed to a further jump in inflation. The March Consumer Price Index (CPI) released earlier this week showed consumer-level inflation rose 8.5% in March over last year — the fastest annual rate since 1981.

""It seems like we’re in the midst of a perfect storm of factors with rising commodity prices, supply chain issues, and a tight labor market so it is not surprising that inflation is rising at its fastest pace in 40 years,"" Bill Price, head of investment management for Commonwealth Financial Network, said in an email Tuesday.

Other recent economic data have also underscored the dual concerns companies have been facing over labor supply challenges and rising costs. In the National Federation of Independent Business' latest monthly small business optimism survey released earlier this week, the firm said 31% of surveyed owners reported that inflation was their single-most important business problem, edging out ""labor quality"" as the top concern. That also marked the highest proportion of firms citing ""inflation"" as their top problem since 1981.

“Inflation has impacted small businesses throughout the country and is now their most important business problem,”NFIB Chief Economist Bill Dunkelberg NFIB said in the release. “With inflation, an ongoing staffing shortage, and supply chain disruptions, small business owners remain pessimistic about their future business conditions.”

This post will be updated with the results of the Labor Department's weekly jobless claims report Thursday at 8:30 a.m. ET. Check back for updates.

""It's a really big deal,"" says DeSpirito on Yahoo Finance Live.

DeSpirito explains that since the end of the financial crisis, the economy has experienced very low growth, very low inflation and very low rates. But those factors largely ended during the pandemic, with that regime being one with high inflation and a love for stay-at-home stocks.

Now things are changing once more as home prices have shot higher at this point in the pandemic, stock prices are still elevated, the unemployment rate is sub 4% and interest rates are headed upward.

This emerging backdrop means investors have to search for companies that have pricing power and sell unique products. All in, it will be a more complicated backdrop for investors to navigate, concedes DeSpirito.

""This is fertile ground for individual stock pickers,"" says DeSpirito.

To be sure, investors are showing angst ahead of this regime shift, DeSpirito predicts.

A majority of investors, 64%, expect the S&P 500 to break below the 4,000 level this year, according to a new Bank of America survey of fund managers out Tuesday. The S&P 500 currently sits slightly above 4,400.

Despite rising market risks, pros tend to agree with DeSpirito that it makes sense to stay Overweight stocks. It just boils down to being more selective than in recent years.

466,2022-04-12T12:32:02+00:00,Inflation rises by the most since 1981 as CPI jumps 8.5% in March,"U.S. consumer price increases quickened in March, underscoring ongoing inflationary pressures as supply chain disruptions and shortages lingered across the economy.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics' (BLS) Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 8.5% in March compared to the same month last year, according to the latest report released Tuesday. That marked the fastest rise since December 1981. This followed a 7.9% annual increase in February. Heading into the report, consensus economists were looking for an 8.4% jump for March, according to Bloomberg data.

On a month-over-month basis, prices rose 1.2% in March following a 0.8% monthly rise in February.

Some of the biggest contributors to the latest increase in inflation were food, shelter and gasoline, according to the BLS. In fact, the index tracking gas prices surged to rise 18.3% month-on-month in March, comprising more than half of the total monthly increase in CPI. In February, gasoline had posted a 6.6% monthly increase.

But even excluding more volatile food and energy prices, the CPI also posted a marked move higher in March. The core CPI jumped 6.5% in March over last year, accelerating from a 6.4% increase in February and representing the fastest increase since August 1982.

A number of other major categories also contributed to the March increase in CPI, however. Shelter prices rose 0.5% month-on-month in March and by 5.0% over last year, representing the biggest annual rise since May 1991. Airline fares also soared by 10.7% on a monthly basis and by nearly 24% over last year, as rising fuel cos and increased demand for travel pushed ticket prices still higher.

Headline consumer price increases have accelerated on an annual basis for seven consecutive months now. Imbalances between supply and demand have persisted, especially in labor — with job openings still far outpacing new hires — and in commodities amid Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine. Many of these costs have been passed on continuously to the consumer.

Story continues

With definitive signs of a peak yet to be seen in inflation, members of the Federal Reserve have escalated their rhetoric on using monetary policy tools to bring down fast-rising prices. Last week, Fed Governor Lael Brainard said that bringing down inflation was ""our most important task,"" while San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said that high inflation was ""as harmful as not having a job.""

Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve's March meeting minutes suggested that ""many participants ... would have preferred a 50 basis point increase"" in benchmark interest rates, with the larger-than-typical rate hike serving as an aggressive move toward raising borrowing costs and bringing down demand.

The Federal Reserve is set to convene for a policy-setting meeting May 3 and 4.

""We do put some weight on the historical patterns [of the labor market] and believe that the overheating of the labor market has raised the risk of recession meaningfully. The yield curve seems to discount a recession probability in 2023 of about one in three, roughly double the unconditional average, and we would broadly concur with this assessment,"" warned Goldman Sachs Chief economist Jan Hatzius in a new client note on Tuesday.

Without question, talk of a looming recession has intensified on Wall Street amid hot reads on inflation, an inversion of the yield curve and elevated energy costs for households.

This week has already brought another worrying signal on inflation.

Expectations about inflation over the next 12 months for U.S. consumers hit a record 6.6% in March, according to new data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. In February, those expectations stood at a still bloated 6%.

Tuesday's closely watched Consumer Price Index (CPI) is expected to hit more than 8% on the headline, underscoring the findings in the New York Fed survey.

Keep in mind, the latest jobs report for March only showed average hourly earnings rising 5.6% over the past 12 months. In other words, consumer purchasing power is being eroded at the same time interest rates are heading higher.

That's not exactly a great combination.

Big investors are beginning to take notice of these recession calls and trends, even if they are still staying mostly bullish on stocks.

Global growth optimism has sunk to an all-time low among fund managers, per a new survey from Bank of America today. The percentage of investors expecting economic conditions to weaken hit its highest ever level seen in the survey. Stagflation expectations approached levels not seen since summer 2008.

""I would say that it's probably closer to a coin toss that the economy will be moving into recession by the end of the year,"" said Dreyfus and Mellon Chief economist and macro strategist Vince Reinhart on Yahoo Finance Live.

Tuesday, April 12, 2022

Today's newsletter is by Emily McCormick, a reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow her on Twitter

This week, first-quarter earnings season begins in earnest with the big banks, from JPMorgan Chase (JPM) to Goldman Sachs (GS), posting results.

And this earnings season, there will be one clear factor separating the winners from the losers.

“Really, what the market’s going to be focused on is margins: How are corporates being able to manage the increased inflation and cost input inflation that they’re seeing come through,” Erin Browne, PIMCO portfolio manager, told Yahoo Finance Live. “That’s going to be the key differentiator for stocks.”

Margins are a closely watched measure of profitability every earnings season. But in an environment in which inflation is running at 40-year highs and has yet to show meaningful signs of peaking, the ability for companies to maintain pricing power and pass on the higher costs to consumers has taken on increased importance.

Generally speaking, profit margins for S&P 500 companies are expected to shrink in the first quarter, compared to the previous quarter and 2021. That’s especially true for non-energy firms that have gotten hit by soaring oil and other energy commodity prices seen so far in 2022.

As David Kostin of Goldman Sachs points out, consensus analysts are looking for S&P 500 aggregate margins to contract by just 5 basis points to reach 11.8% in Q1 compared to last year. But excluding energy stocks, that decline will likely be more pronounced, with margins compressing by 58 basis points compared to last year. Notably, energy has been by far the best-performing S&P 500 sector this year, jumping nearly 40% so far in 2022, compared to an almost 7% decline in the broader index.

But that’s not to say energy stocks are the only place to look for margin resilience this earnings season. Kostin’s team put together a list of major companies that have historically maintained “high and stable gross margins.” These companies span a variety of sectors and industries, from Alphabet (communication services) with a five-year average margin level of 57%, to Tapestry and Lululemon (consumer discretionary) with 69% and 54%, respectively. Others include Coca-Cola (61%) in consumer staples, TransUnion (53%) and CoStar Group (76%) in industrials, and Adobe (85%) and Oracle (76%) in information technology.

Story continues

Eva Ados, ERShares chief operating officer, also offered a vote of confidence for technology stocks when it comes to maintaining margins, even as tech shares overall have come under pressure for much of this year.

“What’s unique about tech companies is that in an inflationary environment, they can still satisfy the investors because they’re nimble, they’re flexible, and they can stop chasing revenues if they choose to,” Ados told Yahoo Finance Live. “They can change the equation between their margins and their revenue growth.”

“We’re going to see lower SG&A [selling, general and administrative] costs, lower marketing spends, lower revenue growth, but bigger margins,” she added. “That’s going to satisfy investors.” King Penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) Adult with chicks, South Georgia Island

On the flip side, Kostin also highlighted a series of stocks with “low and variable gross margins,” or typically low pricing power. These included Live Nation Entertainment and Disney in communication services with five-year average margin levels of 17% and 33%, respectively, along with Wynn Resorts (20%) and Las Vegas Sands Corp. (31%) in consumer discretionary, Hormel Foods Corporation (20%) in consumer staples, and Lockheed Martin (13%) in industrials, to name a few.

To be sure, this quarter, these companies may ultimately deliver margins better or worse than these historical averages suggest. But these do provide reference points for how firms have in the past managed to sustain margins over multiple quarters — and show that firms even in the same industries can have disparate success rates in preserving profitability.

But even as some firms are able to continue passing on costs, companies across the board are expected to endure rising expenses in the first quarter, as the cost of everything from labor to energy and raw materials rise.

As FactSet notes, of the nearly two dozen early earnings reports in the S&P 500 that had posted first-quarter results through April 7, labor costs and ongoing supply and demand imbalances remained some of the biggest callouts.

“Labor costs and shortages have been cited by the highest number of companies in the index to date as a factor that had a negative impact on earnings and revenues in Q1, or is expected to have a negative impact on earnings or revenues in future quarters,” FactSet’s John Butters said in a note Friday. “Of these 20 companies, ​​13 (or 65%) have discussed a negative impact from this factor. After labor shortages and costs, COVID costs and impacts (12) and supply chain costs and disruptions (12) have been discussed by the highest number of S&P 500 companies.”

In the next few weeks, we’ll see which companies have most effectively been able to navigate these concerns.

That’s the takeaway from the last panel of the first day at the Exchange conference in Miami Beach, Florida.

Taking place at the Fontainebleau, the Exchange is a massive new ETF conference focused on the “exchange of ideas.” The conference officially kicks off Tuesday, April 12, but Monday featured a handful of educational panels and one panel dedicated to advisors and how they are navigating the current market environment.

Tom Lydon, CEO of ETF Flows, moderated the advisor session, which included various survey questions that were provided to advisors, as well as the resulting answers. A group of self-proclaimed “ETF Nerds” provided color commentary on the results.

Rangebound Market

The panel kicked off with a window into advisors’ expectation of stock market returns. About 60% of advisors who participated in the survey believed that the S&P 500 would be rangebound, fluctuating at only a 10% trading range, over the rest of 2022. That didn’t surprise Eric Balchunas, ETF analyst at Bloomberg.

“Rates rising obviously hurts growth stocks, but it really hurts bond funds,” he said. “And I think people are rotating out of bond funds, but there’is really not much else to do, so they are buying equities because TINA [there is no alternative],” he said. Balchunas noted that flows into equity ETFs are tentative, but positive. Investors are basically saying, “I’ll buy more IVV, VOO and SPY; what else am I going to do?”

Todd Rosenbluth, head of research at ETF Trends, and Dave Nadig, financial futurist for ETF Trends, agreed that a rangebound market is more likely than a bear market.

“The market is up more often than it is down. If you’re a long-term investor, then if it falls more than 5-10%, then that’s a buying opportunity.” explained Rosenbluth. “Money is sticking with ETFs, despite what’s going on with the overall marketplace. We’re going to get $800 billion of net inflows, with the stock market and the bond market down. That’s impressive in a down market.”

Story continues

Nadig concurred: “I think part of the reason we’re not going to go down more than 10% [in the S&P 500] is because there’s going to be $600 billion of flows coming in from the ETF community, supporting equity prices.”

Advisor Worries

There are always plenty of things for advisors to worry about, but at the present time, the survey suggested that advisors are most concerned about rising inflation and interest rates, closely followed by geopolitics. That’s understandable, said ETF Trends’ Rosenbluth, but that thankfully, there are plenty of ETFs available to help.

“The beauty of the ETF space is they’ve found ways to help advisors who are worried about rising interest rates and are worried about inflation. We’ve seen a number of successful products that have come to market,” he noted.

“The Horizon Kinetics Inflation Beneficiaries ETF (INFL) is an example of one of those products that came to market last year and is an inflation beneficiary.” Rosenbluth added. “You don’t have to just protect against inflation; you can actually try to find the winners that are out there. The AXS Astoria Inflation Sensitive ETF (PPI) is another product in that category.”

Ben Johnson, director of global ETF research at Morningstar, was a bit more skeptical that ETFs were a panacea for the ills of inflation.

“The best time to protect yourself against a multidecade spike in inflation is before the multidecade spike in inflation has happened,” he explained. “Now we have an ETF for every 'flation' you can think of; we have inflation ETFs, we’ve got stagflation ETFs, we’ve got deflation ETFs—all of which can be perfectly good tools—but you’ve got to be out there mending the hole in the roof of your house when the sun is shining, not in the middle of a downpour.”

Meanwhile, Elisabeth Kashner, director of ETF research at FactSet, argued that higher interest rates could actually be an opportunity.

“Even if Ben is right [and it’s better to act preemptively against inflation], I think we forget that bond funds will take a price hit straight up, and so you’ll see a hit to your balance sheet,” she said. But on the flip side, you do get a higher coupon going forward, and your future total returns will be that much more robust. So, if you missed the correct ‘flation’ play, you’ve got a little bit of an uncomfortable conversation with your client right now. But six to nine months from now, you’re going to start to really appreciate [higher rates].”

Managing Downside Risks

Managing client portfolios is never easy, but during times of high volatility, the job only gets harder. Fortunately, ETFs could help with that.

“When I talk to advisors about how they’re managing volatility, a lot of them are reassessing diversification from the get-go; they’re asking ‘do I actually have enough different sources of return in the portfolio?’” said Nadig.

“There’s some really interesting work done by WisdomTree related to the WisdomTree U.S. Efficient Core Fund (NTSX),” he noted. “It’s their 60/90 product that gives you a 60/40 portfolio—levered up; not to take more risk, but to be able to allocate more to alternatives.”

Nadig added: “There are so many interesting products coming out to provide those different patterns of returns. The Simplify Interest Rate Hedge ETF (PFIX) just launched, which is a direct play on rising interest rates. It’s an interesting way to balance out your long bond portfolio.”

Portfolio Fit Matters Most

The panel finished off by looking at the question of what characteristics advisors place the most emphasis on when selecting an investment strategy for their clients’ portfolios. The results pleasantly surprised some of the panelists, including Rosenbluth.

“This is so exciting to me,” he said. “We’re an industry that looks to ‘race to the bottom’ on cost; we’re an industry that’s historically looked at past performance to buy something, and yet those two categories [were less important to advisors than portfolio fit and methodology].”

Chicago, IL – April 11, 2022 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. ETF recently featured in the blog include SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, iShares Core S&P 500 ETF IVV, Vanguard S&P 500 ETF VOO, SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 ETF SPLG, and Invesco S&P 500 Top 50 ETF XLG.

Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:

S&P 500 ETFs to Buy on Bullish Analyst Ratings

Wall Street logged its worst performance in two years, with the S&P 500 losing 4.9% in the first quarter. The combination of factors like skyrocketing inflation, a war in Ukraine and aggressive Fed rate hike bets led to risk-off trade. However, the companies on the S&P 500 got the most analyst Buy ratings in more than a decade.

In order to tap this bullishness, investors should bet on the ETFs that track the S&P 500 Index.

Bullish View

Wall Street analysts remained bullish on stocks as these have become cheap at the current levels. The S&P 500 is currently trading at P/E ratio of 25.92, down from 30.02 at the start of the year (read: U.S. Stocks Log Worst Q1 in 2 Years: Top-Ranked ETFs Shine).

According to new data from FactSet, analysts mostly had Buy ratings on stocks on the S&P 500 as a percentage of their total ratings during February and March in over a decade. Of the 10,821 ratings on companies tracked by the benchmark, 57.3% had an investment analyst recommendation to purchase their stock as of Mar 31. The last time, the percentage of Buy ratings exceeded 55% at the end of any month was at 55.8% in September 2011.

The optimistic outlook was likely driven by an increase in earnings estimates for S&P 500 companies over the past several months. Many companies on the index are expected to show double-digit revenue growth throughout 2022. Per the Earnings Trends, total S&P 500 earnings for the first quarter of 2022 are expected to be up 3.2% from the same period last year on 10.0% higher revenues.

473,2022-04-11T16:06:51+00:00,"Will the US economy enter a recession? It's 'a coin toss,' says strategist","Add another prominent voice in the field of economics warning about a looming recession.

""I would say that it's probably closer to a coin toss that the economy will be moving into recession by the end of the year,"" said Dreyfus and Mellon Chief economist and macro strategist Vince Reinhart on Yahoo Finance Live.

Reinhart's comments come amid multiple negative forces playing out in the economy.

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 7.9% in February, marking the fastest pace of annual inflation in 40 years amid a push higher in rent, food and used car prices. On Tuesday, the CPI could show an increase north of 8% on the headline for March as Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Semenova reports.

Meanwhile, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index (PCE) rose 6.4% in February, accelerating from a 6.1% increase in January.

It represented the fastest rate of inflation since 1982.

Hot reads on inflation in recent weeks has prompted more hawkish talk on interest rate increases from Fed members such as Lael Brainard. That tough talk on inflation fighting could continue this week as Brainard and other closely watched Fed members speak at various events.

Given high levels of inflation and rising rates — which has sent the 30-year mortgage ballooning to 5% — many economists are warning of an impending recession by sometime in 2023. Deutsche Bank's Matthew Luzzetti became the first economist from a major investment to call a recession a week ago.

He isn't alone.

""When we think of a mild recession I think the best example is probably what happened in 2021, maybe a 2 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate, a couple of quarters of weak GDP growth,"" Dent said. ""In terms of time willing, we are most concerned about potentially 2024. We think that the cumulative risk of a recession between now and the end of 2024 stands at about 35% to 40%. A lot of that is just coming from what we think is going to be this very aggressive response from the Fed to actually get inflation under control and make sure the labor market actually cools down,"" said Nomura Chief U.S. economist Robert Dent on Yahoo Finance Live.

Story continues

Added Dent, ""We would largely agree that the inflation situation facing the Fed is quite a conundrum for them, and it will be difficult to navigate.""

For his part, Reinhart is expecting three, 50 basis point rate hikes from the Fed soon.

Explained Reinhart, ""The yield curve is inverted by many measures. Oil prices are considerably higher. The Fed is tightening. We are getting closer to full employment. Trees don't grow to the sky. I think if you are looking over the next year and a half or so, you should think of a recession easily as a coin toss.""

476,2022-04-10T18:03:12+00:00,"Bank earnings, CPI inflation, retail sales: What to know this holiday-shortened week","A flurry of big bank earnings and fresh inflation data out of Washington are expected to keep investors busy this holiday-shortened trading week. Market participants will also tune in Wednesday for a key economic report on March retail sales activity.

Despite a four-day trading session, with Wall Street closed for Good Friday, a pivotal week is underway for investors as mega-banks including JPMorgan Chase, (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), and Citigroup (C) get the ball rolling on Q1 earnings season. On the economic data front, markets will get the latest gauge of U.S. inflation with Tuesday’s closely-watched Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Producer Price Index (PPI) set for publication Wednesday.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics’ (BLS) March read on CPI is expected to come in red hot again, with inflation unlikely to show any signs of abating as supply chain snarls continue to flare up prices, particularly with Russia’s war in Ukraine weighs on flows of global energy and commodities.

Consensus economists anticipate headline CPI will again accelerate to show an 8.4% year-over-year increase, surging higher from February’s 7.9% rise, according to Bloomberg consensus data. The figure would mark another decades-high rate of inflation, with the index, even excluding volatile food and energy prices, set to climb as much as 6.6%, up from February’s 6.4% increase.

On a month-over-month basis, economists are looking for a 0.5% rise — a print that would mark 22 consecutive monthly advances on consumer prices across the U.S.

“The upcoming Consumer Price Index for March will not be pretty,” Bankrate chief financial analyst Greg McBride said in a note. “Inflation has continued to accelerate in recent months and with the higher gasoline and food prices stemming from the war in Ukraine, the worst is likely still to come.”

The newest CPI print is due out as markets grapple with the likelihood Federal Reserve officials will act more aggressively to rein in inflation after a hawkish readout of minutes last week from the central bank’s March meeting suggested ""many"" policymakers favored a double-bump interest rate hike to combat surging price levels. Conversations detailed in the March 15-16 Fed minutes indicated the bank will soon begin to unwind its $9 trillion balance sheet and signaled members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) “would have preferred a 50 basis point increase"" in benchmark interest rates last month when the Fed raised rates for the first time since 2018.

Story continues

The minutes also echo recent public remarks from Fed leaders, including commentary on Thursday from St. Louis Fed President James Bullard who said he wanted the central bank to get to between 3% and 3.25% on the Fed funds rate in the second half of this year, implying more aggressive, front-loaded interest rate hikes in the near-term. Fed Governor Lael Brainard also said last week that the FOMC was ""prepared to take stronger action,"" should inflation readings remain elevated and warrant such moves. WASHINGTON, DC - MARCH 21: Federal Reserve Board Chair Jerome Powell speaks during a luncheon at the 2022 NABE Economic Policy Conference at the Ritz-Carlton on March 21, 2022 in Washington, DC. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates a quarter of a percentage point last week for the first time since 2018 in an attempt to combat rising inflation. (Photo by Samuel Corum/Getty Images)

“With prices increasing everywhere you look and both consumers and businesses bracing for more, it is time for the Federal Reserve to take the gloves off,” McBride said. ""The Fed is now much more inclined to boost interest rates by one-half percentage point at their meeting in May, and very possibly beyond.”

Inflation numbers are underway this week not only on the consumer side but f​​rom the perspective of costs to producers supplying goods. The Producer Price Index (PPI) set for release Wednesday is expected to show another elevated figure, with Bloomberg economists expecting a reading of 10.6% year-over-year, up from the already higher-than-expected 10.0% in the prior month. Last month, economists at Bank of America said the headline number was “boosted by blistering strength in commodities” as energy and food prices jolted higher.

“Underlying inflation pressures likely remain elevated given constrained supply chains and tightening labor markets,” BofA said in the note from last month.

Meanwhile on Wednesday, investors will be watching for March retail sales numbers. Consensus economists are expecting retail sales excluding autos, released by the U.S. Census Bureau, increased slightly last month by 0.6%, compared to February’s advance of 0.3%, according to Bloomberg data. The number, however, remains low compared to a rise of 1.0% in January. Bank of America economists attributed a window in retail sales activity to slower auto purchases but expect rising gas prices will offset weakness in auto related spending. According to BofA data, gas spending surged by 6.5% month-over-month in March as retail gas prices reached historic highs.

Bank earnings

On the earnings front, investors will see a pick-up in releases of quarterly results with some of the largest U.S. banks commencing a new corporate reporting season. JPMorgan is the first set to unveil its Q1 numbers on Wednesday, with a lineup of other industry heavyweights following suit before the bell on Thursday: Wells Fargo (WFC), Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS), and Citigroup (C).

Banks stand to benefit from the backdrop of monetary tightening by the Fed, with higher interest rates poised to increase banks’ net interest income (the bank’s earnings on its lending activities and interest it pays to depositors) and net interest margins (calculated by dividing net interest income by the average income earned from interest-producing assets.)

However, analysts are expecting a lackluster year for the industry’s earnings despite the profitability boost, specifically compared to the profit boom last year. In 2021, bank balance sheets benefited significantly from releasing COVID-era credit loss allowances, reserves financial institutions accumulated at the start of the pandemic to absorb the potential shock of borrowers being unable to pay their debts. This year, that financial boost will be absent from results. Bank profits were also lifted by exceptionally strong dealmaking and trading in 2021, but investment banking revenues stalled after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in late February.

Still, strategists anticipate a solid earnings season overall. According to data from FactSet’s John Butters, analysts have slightly lowered bottom-up EPS estimates on S&P 500 companies in aggregate for the first quarter (a 0.7% decrease from $52.21 to $51.83), from year-end 2021 through March 31. However, they lifted EPS forecasts for the second quarter by 1.6% from $55.16% to $56.07, by 2.4% from $57.82 to $59.23 for the third quarter, and by 3.9% from $58.31 to $60.59 for the fourth quarter. Given the increases in estimates for the second, third, and fourth quarters, analysts also increased EPS estimates for all of 2022, lifting projections by 2.0% for the year from $223.43 to $227.80. While analysts were decreasing EPS estimates in aggregate for the first quarter, they were also increasing EPS estimates in aggregate for the next three quarters.

“In this environment, with valuation expansion potentially tough to come by due to rising interest rates and high inflation, earnings take on more importance,” said LPL Financial equity strategist Jeff Buchbinder in a recent note. “The good news is corporate America is in excellent shape — earnings estimates are higher in 2022 now than they were at the start of the year, which is no small feat.”

Video Transcript

- And for more on the market action, we're bringing into the stream now Chris Zaccarelli, Independent Advisor Alliance chief investment officer. Chris, thanks so much for joining us this afternoon. Stocks are on track to post their first weekly loss after three consecutive weeks of gains. What are your thoughts on what's been driving this latest stretch of volatility here in equity markets?

CHRIS ZACCARELLI: Well, it's absolutely the Federal Reserve. The stock market's been pretty resilient in the face of that horrible war in Ukraine. And clearly, this has been a volatile year. But it's this past week that equity investors have turned their attention back to the Federal Reserve.

The idea that they're going to be raising rates by 50 basis points or more, potentially in multiple meetings, is one factor, but also the idea that they're going to be selling down that enormous balance sheet that they have. They have $9 trillion in securities in their balance sheet, and they just said they're going to have a plan where they're going to reduce that by potentially $95 billion per month, or a pace of about $1 trillion a year. So I think that's really what's got equity investors spooked on the whole, as far as for this week.

- Investors also spooked because they're trying to evaluate, as well, how much the Fed activity and this tightening may also trigger a recession. What would you put that probability at, even though the Fed continues to maintain that it's mitigated-- at least the heightened risk of a recession is mitigated.

CHRIS ZACCARELLI: I mean, I think it's hard to put an exact percentage on it, but clearly the chances of recession have gone up meaningfully. We saw the treasury curve invert, meaning that you had longer-term yields lower than short-term yields. That's reversed, but that's typically a warning sign of an impending recession, at least over, let's say, the next 6 to 18 months.

Story continues

So I think a lot of people are concerned there's going to be a recession. You see some of those really defensive sectors like utilities, consumer staples, as those continue to get more into favor, that's equity investors showing you that they're concerned about a recession. Likewise, if you see those longer-duration assets, like technology or consumer discretionary, having a tough time, which we've seen recently, that's also a sign that potentially interest rates are going to go higher first.

And really, all of those together are what's the problem. The Fed is raising rates because they're trying to combat inflation. And as interest rates go higher, that's, all things being equal, been bad for tech. And you're seeing that again today, with the NASDAQ down over 1%.

- Yeah, and it's been the loser on the week and it's been the loser on the year. And usually, we do see this. When rates are higher, tech stocks get pounded. Do you expect this to continue throughout the quarter?

CHRIS ZACCARELLI: I think markets typically don't move in a straight line, so I'd be surprised if you saw this dynamic play out for the entire quarter, in terms of just yields relentlessly going higher and tech selling off. But in general, I do think tech is going to be challenged for most of this year. And likewise, I think yields are likely to be even higher than they are from here by the end of the year. So over the course of the quarter, I'm sure you'll see ups and downs for both, but ultimately I think the trend is still in place where higher yields and lower tech prices are likely to be the story for the rest of this year.

- We're about to kick off corporate earnings season in earnest next week. We know a slowdown in profit growth is likely, but what do you think is going to be considered good enough on results to help support stocks from here?

CHRIS ZACCARELLI: Well, I think you see the banks kicking off next week, and that's great to see not only how they've done in the past, but what they're forecasting for the future. Really, bank earnings are a great way to get an idea of how the consumer is doing, how businesses are doing. And ultimately, I think if profits can hold up-- the consensus has been bringing the profit estimates back down, but keep in mind, you know, profits are a nominal, as opposed to inflation-adjusted measure. It's possible that we see profitability continue to go higher, even if the economy is slowing down.

Again, the economy has been on a really fast pace. The pace of that increase in the economy has continued to slow, but the economy itself is not necessarily predicted, at this time, to go backwards into recession this year. So I think if there's earnings growth, even at modest levels, let's say single digits, even that 3% to 5% increase, I think, on a company by company basis, that will be considered pretty good news. And I think you'll see the stocks be a lot more resilient, as opposed to seeing even or slightly down earnings, which is where consensus has been headed.

- How are you positioning your portfolio going into this earnings season?

CHRIS ZACCARELLI: So typically, we don't try to move our portfolios around a tremendous amount from quarter to quarter in terms of earnings, but we do try to tilt toward sectors which we think are going to be more resilient. So at this time, we're looking a little bit more towards health care as a sector. We think it's got the dual benefit of providing some growth as the economy continues to grow.

You've also got the idea that, with the COVID reopening now in full force, a lot of those elective surgeries and things that may have been put off during COVID are now more likely to get done. So we think there's an opportunity for growth on the earnings side. On the other hand, if we do go into recession, either early next year or within the next 6 to 12 months, the stock market starts to react accordingly, health care is a pretty defensive sector, as well. So that's one that we think is a good risk/reward, regardless of what the outcomes are this year.

478,2022-04-08T17:06:52+00:00,Slowdown in economy has to be 'dramatic' as Fed raises interest rates: top economist,"Seth Carpenter, Morgan Stanley chief economist and former Federal Reserve deputy director of monetary affairs, thinks there is no way around a sharp slowing of the economy as the Federal Reserve embarks deeper into its rate hiking cycle.

""If you think about what the Fed itself thinks is the long-run sustainable growth rate of the economy, they think that rate of growth is below 2%. And so if you take a growth rate in the economy that's above 5% or 6%, and you're going to try to bring it down to below 2%, that 4-plus percentage point deceleration is just a massive, massive deceleration to happen, even if it happens over the course of two years or so. So I think no two ways about it, the slowing in the economy has to be dramatic,"" Carpenter said on Yahoo Finance Live.

To be sure, the Fed is in quite the pickle right now as it tries to cool red-hot inflation but not wreck the economy at the same time.

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 7.9% in February, marking the fastest pace of annual inflation in 40 years amid a push higher in rent, food and used car prices. Meanwhile, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index (PCE) rose 6.4% in February, accelerating from a 6.1% increase in January.

It represented the fastest rate of inflation since 1982.

As prices have climbed throughout the economy, the Federal Reserve has begun to hike interest rates to cool things down. The pace of rate hikes may be quicker than most market participants expect. This week alone market participants have been forced to digest hawkish comments from key Fed members Lael Brainard and Patrick Harker.

In turn, that has placed upward pressure on bond yields and downward pressure on stock prices.

Deutsche Bank's Matthew Luzzetti became the first economist from a major Wall Street firm to predict a U.S. recession amid these numerous crosscurrents in the economy.

""What I think comes out very clearly is that they're in a very challenging situation. And I have a lot of sympathy for the bind that they're in,"" Carpenter said.

479,2022-04-08T14:05:02+00:00,S&amp;P 500 ETFs to Buy on Bullish Analyst Ratings,"Wall Street logged its worst performance in two years, with the S&P 500 losing 4.9% in the first quarter. The combination of factors like skyrocketing inflation, a war in Ukraine and aggressive Fed rate hike bets led to risk-off trade. However, the companies on the S&P 500 got the most analyst Buy ratings in more than a decade.

In order to tap this bullishness, investor should bet on the ETFs that track the S&P 500 Index. These include SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, iShares Core S&P 500 ETF IVV, Vanguard S&P 500 ETF VOO, SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 ETF SPLG and Invesco S&P 500 Top 50 ETF XLG.

Bullish View

Wall Street analysts remained bullish on stocks as these have become cheap at the current levels. The S&P 500 is currently trading at P/E ratio of 25.92, down from 30.02 at the start of the year (read: U.S. Stocks Log Worst Q1 in 2 Years: Top-Ranked ETFs Shine).

According to new data from FactSet, analysts mostly had Buy ratings on stocks on the S&P 500 as a percentage of their total ratings during February and March in over a decade. Of the 10,821 ratings on companies tracked by the benchmark, 57.3% had an investment analyst recommendation to purchase their stock as of Mar 31. The last time, the percentage of Buy ratings exceeded 55% at the end of any month was at 55.8% in September 2011.

The optimistic outlook was likely driven by an increase in earnings estimates for S&P 500 companies over the past several months. Many companies on the index are expected to show double-digit revenue growth throughout 2022. Per the Earnings Trends, total S&P 500 earnings for the first quarter of 2022 are expected to be up 3.2% from the same period last year on 10.0% higher revenues.

SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY)

SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust tracks the S&P 500 Index and holds 506 stocks in its basket, with each accounting for no more than 7% of assets. SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust is heavy on the information technology sector while healthcare, consumer discretionary and financials round off the next four spots with a double-digit allocation each (read: 5 ETFs Up 20%+ in S&P 500's Best Week Since November 2020).

SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust charges investors 9 bps in annual fees and trades in an average daily volume of 96.8 million shares. It has AUM of $412 billion and a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy) with a Medium risk outlook.

iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV)

With AUM of $333.7 million, iShares Core S&P 500 ETF is a lot smaller than SPY and less liquid, trading in an average daily volume of 7.5 million. It charges just 3 bps in annual fees, 6 bps less than the State Street product. iShares Core S&P 500 ETF has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) (read: 5 ETFs That Gained Investors' Love in Q1).

Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO)

Vanguard S&P 500 ETF also directly tracks the S&P 500 Index and holds 507 stocks in its basket. It has amassed $292.7 billion in its asset base and charges investors 3 bps in annual fees. Vanguard S&P 500 ETF trades in an average daily volume of 7 million shares and has a Zacks ETF Rank #2.

SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 ETF (SPLG)

SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 ETF also follows the S&P 500 Index and holds 505 stocks in its basket with 0.03% in expense ratio. It has amassed $14.8 billion in its asset base and trades in a solid volume of 6 million shares a day on an average. SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 ETF has a Zacks ETF Rank #2.

Invesco S&P 500 Top 50 ETF (XLG)

Invesco S&P 500 Top 50 ETF follows the S&P 500 Top 50 ETF Index, which measures the cap-weighted performance of 50 of the largest companies on the S&P 500 Index, reflecting the performance of the U.S. mega-cap stocks. Invesco S&P 500 Top 50 ETF has been able to manage assets worth $2.4 billion but trades in a moderate volume of about 85,000 shares a day on average.

480,2022-04-08T11:25:37+00:00,Best Stocks for 2022: Bristol-Myers Squibb Isn’t Done Growing,"Editor’s note: This column is part of InvestorPlace.com’s Best Stocks for 2022 contest. Sure Dividend’s pick for the contest is Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) stock.

As of the end of the first quarter of 2022, Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) had generated total returns of 17.1%. This compares very favorably to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust’s (NYSEARCA:SPY) loss of 4.9% over the same period. Image of ""10 Best Stocks - 2022""

Source: InvestorPlace

What most stood out about an investment in Bristol-Myers-Squibb at the end of 2021 was its low valuation. The stock appeared significantly undervalued at the time. Here’s what I said about the company at that time:

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

“We expect adjusted earnings-per-share of $7.48 for the year. This gives the company a price-to-earnings ratio of just 8.2 using expected fiscal 2021 adjusted earnings-per-share…

“…We believe a conservative fair value price-to-earnings ratio for Bristol-Myers Squibb is 13.5. This is by no means a high price-to-earnings ratio. The S&P 500’s price-to-earnings ratio is 28.7 for comparison. It’s worth noting that Bristol-Myers Squibb traded above a price-to-earnings ratio of 13.5 for much of the last decade, prior to 2020.

“If the company returned to a price-to-earnings ratio of 13.5 from its current price-to-earnings ratio of just 7.9, investors would realize gains of around 70%.”

BMY Stock Isn’t Done Growing

Bristol-Myers Squibb’s price has increased significantly in 2022, but I believe there’s still plenty of room left for the stock to run further. Our fair price-to-earnings ratio estimate for Bristol-Myers Squibb hasn’t changed.

7 Safe Stocks to Buy to Guard Against a Recession

The company’s earnings-per-share are coming in better than we hoped for. The company closed out fiscal 2021 with adjusted earnings-per-share of $7.51, slightly ahead of our estimate of $7.48.

And the company’s management is guiding for even better earnings-per-share in fiscal 2022. The company’s adjusted earnings-per-share guidance is for a range between $7.65 and $7.95. Our fiscal 2022 estimate is for adjusted earnings-per-share to land at $7.80, at the midpoint of guidance.

Story continues

Based on its end-of-quarter share price of $73.03 and expected fiscal 2022 adjusted earnings-per-share of $7.80, Bristol-Myers Squibb is trading for a price-to-earnings ratio of just 9.4. For comparison, the S&P 500is trading for a price-to-earnings ratio of 25.6 using trailing-twelve-months earnings.

With a current price-to-earnings ratio of 9.4, and a target price-to-earnings ratio of 13.5, we believe that there is still 44% upside to Bristol-Myers Squibb at current prices. The stock still appears significantly undervalued.

Bristol-Myers Squibb stock still rewards investors for holding it and waiting for valuation levels to rise, because the stock offers a relatively high dividend yield of 2.9%. This isn’t the enviable 3%+ yield the stock offered three months ago, but it is well above the S&P 500’s dividend yield of 1.3%.

On top of the low valuation and solid dividend yield, Bristol-Myers Squibb also has positive growth expectations ahead. The company is targeting 3.9% adjusted earnings-per-share growth this year based on the midpoint of guidance. This growth is coming off of excellent 16.6% adjusted earnings-per-share growth in fiscal 2021. From fiscal 2012 through fiscal 2021, the company generated phenomenal adjusted earnings-per-share growth of 23.1% annually.

Don’t Fear the Patent Cliff

That being said, we are expecting growth to slow in coming years due to the company’s blockbuster pharmaceutical Revlimid beginning to lose its patent protection this year. Indeed, “patent cliff” fears are likely why investors can buy BMY stock at such a discount right now.

But fear-influenced investors are missing the bigger picture at Bristol-Myers Squibb. The company’s management team expects low to mid-single digit revenue growth from 2020 through 2025. The company is not expected to shrink, despite current fears.

Despite the runup in price over the first 3 months of 2022, we continue to believe that Bristol-Myers Squibb is both undervalued and a strong buy for investors looking for value, safety and dividends.

Friday, April 8, 2022

Today's newsletter is by Sam Ro, the author of TKer.co. Follow him on Twitter at @SamRo.

Before tensions escalated between Ukraine and Russia in February, a bullish stock market story had been unfolding: Wall Street analysts were revising up their forecasts for 2022 and 2023 corporate earnings.

Since then, geopolitical risks spiked, becoming the top concern among investors. The stock market got rocked, sending the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to a low of 4,114 on February 24.

Meanwhile, inflation data continued to confirm prices were rising at a troubling rate, which caused Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues to signal that they were willing to get more aggressive in tightening monetary policy.

Despite these headwinds, something surprising happened: Analysts continued to revise their forecasts for earnings higher.

According to FactSet, analysts expect the S&P 500 to earn $227.80 per share in 2022. This estimate is 2% higher than the $223.43 expected as of December 31, 2021.

Yes, the upward revision is modest. But it follows all of the new concerns that have emerged since the beginning of the year.

Some — not all — of this resilience can be explained by energy producers’ earnings, which have been bolstered by rising energy costs.

“A significant portion of the upgrade comes from the Energy sector (+2.0pp), while companies that are impacted by higher energy costs (-0.5pp) and those exposed to European (-0.2pp) have been minor drags,” Binky Chadha, chief U.S. equity strategist for Deutsche Bank, wrote on Tuesday. “Excluding the impact of these effects, full year estimates are still up +0.8%.”

So, what’s happening here?

It’s simple: The economy continues to be in great shape, supported by massive tailwinds.

Among other things, businesses and consumers have very healthy finances. Businesses continue to invest aggressively in their operations. Consumers — despite having gripes about inflation — continue to spend on goods and services. Consumer finances have been bolstered by $2.5 trillion in excess savings, which has allowed companies facing higher costs to preserve profit margins by raising prices.

Story continues

Of course, we’re talking about expectations for earnings. And these expectations are sure to get updated as companies announce their quarterly results in the coming weeks. The lingering question: Will these expectations continue to get revised up, or will they finally begin to get revised down?

482,2022-04-07T22:25:03+00:00,"Stock market news live updates: Stock futures steady after rebound, with Fed in focus","U.S. stock futures opened little changed Thursday evening, with investors continuing to contemplate the next policy moves by the Federal Reserve.

Contracts on the S&P 500 hugged that flat line. Earlier, stocks ended higher for the first time in three days, shaking off volatility from earlier this week. Still, the S&P 500 was on track to post a weekly loss and end a three-week winning streak, if levels hold through Friday's close.

Fresh commentary from Federal Reserve officials remained in focus on Thursday, as another set of speakers offered a mixed set of commentary on the policy path forward for the central bank. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said Thursday that he wanted the Fed to get to between 3% and 3.25% on the Fed funds rate in the second half of this year, implying more aggressive, front-loaded interest rate hikes in the near-term. Bullard was the only dissenter in the Fed's March meeting, calling for a larger 50 basis point interest rate hike versus the 25 basis point hike that ultimately occurred.

While Bullard has now been a longer-term hawk seeking greater action from the Fed to rein in inflation, earlier remarks this week suggested other members of the central bank were also warming to the idea of tightening policy. Fed Governor Lael Brainard said that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) was ""prepared to take stronger action,"" should inflation readings remain elevated and warrant such moves. And in the Fed's meeting minutes released Wednesday afternoon, the central bank revealed that ""many participants ... would have preferred a 50 basis point increase"" in rates, and also suggested the Fed was gearing up to soon announce the start of its balance-sheet runoff process.

However, other Fed officials offered a more measured approach to raising rates. In remarks Thursday, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said it would be ""appropriate"" to move the benchmark interest rate ""closer to a neutral position,"" suggesting a somewhat less hasty series of interest rate hikes. Meanwhile, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans suggested the Fed would be able to ""get to neutral, look around, and find that we're not necessarily that far from where we need to go.""

Story continues

Taken together, the confluence of commentary at least temporarily helped stocks pause their latest bout of volatility from earlier this week, and kept Treasury yields steadier after a steep march higher. The benchmark 10-year yield held around 2.6% for its highest level since 2019.

""The market actually had to digest a lot of information — a lot of hawkish information from the Fed over the last couple of days. We had been in a sell-off mode. And I think [Thursday] we finally got a chance to take a breather and realize that the equity markets especially have some actual positive things that are going on,"" Kevin Nicholson, chief investment officer of global fixed income at RiverFront Investment Group, told Yahoo Finance Live on Thursday. ""We still expect the earnings season to be better than expectations ... We also think that you have support with a strong labor market. ""The economy is in great shape from that perspective.""

""We expect that equity markets will rebound,"" he added. ""And we actually are looking for them to go back up toward their highs of 4,800 over the few months, especially as they get more clarity from the Fed. As we all know, equity markets do not like uncertainty.""

Investors around the globe are looking for ways to strengthen their portfolios as stock markets become more volatile. One of the best ways of protecting a growth portfolio in an inflationary market is investments in exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Some of the benefits that ETFs offer include diversification and low costs. For example, ETFs cover most major asset classes and offer you a single-trade diversification chance. In addition, the operating expense ratios of ETFs are low and many finance advisors offer access to them on zero trade commissions.

Some other advantages of investing in ETFs include trading flexibility, transparency, and tax efficiency. Trading flexibility is demonstrated by the versatility that ETFs offer in terms of moving money between stocks, bonds, or commodities. As a majority of ETFs disclose their holdings on a daily basis, there is a lot more transparency involved in their trade compared to alternatives like mutual funds. Factors like lower turnover and the in-kind creation/redemption process mean fewer capital gains are passed onto investors, leading to lower taxes.

Historically, ETFs have come a long way since their inception. The first ETF in the US was launched in 1993 under the S&P 500 SPDR name. As of April 7, SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) has over $416 billion in net assets and is trading at a price of $447. The second-largest ETF in the market, launched in the year 2000, is the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:IVV). As of April 7, this fund has an average trading volume of 8,667,283 and a share price in excess of $448.

Even though ETFs are lauded for the variety they offer to investors, there are some who also blame them for making the markets more volatile. The popularity of ETFs, on the other hand, increases dramatically in times of volatility as investors use them as safe havens during crisis situations. Research firm ETFGI estimates that ETFs are now a $9 trillion global market. Market experts like Salim Ramji, an investment manager at Blackrock, expect this number to cross $15 trillion in value within the next three years.

Story continues

Institutional investors and insurance firms are also investing in ETFs. Investor concerns around ETFs were cooled by a decision of the Federal Reserve to buy ETFs tracking corporate bonds. Even though the market is largely bullish on ETFs, there are a few bears who have warned of the negative effects of a larger economic slowdown on the funds sector. Craig Siegenthaler, a senior analyst at Credit Suisse, told the Financial Times last year that “if we get a bear market that will make it tougher for the industry to keep growing at the pace we have seen”.

Nevertheless, ETFs offer investors the chance to grow their portfolios significantly over time, making them ideal choices for a retirement or savings portfolio. Some of the top holdings of retirement ETFs popular in the US include Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET), Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), and American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT), among others discussed in detail below.

Best ETFs to Invest In for Retirement

10. Vanguard 500 Index Fund (NYSE:VOO)

Vanguard 500 Index Fund (NYSE:VOO) is a fund that tracks the performance of the S&P 500 Index. The index is widely considered the benchmark index of the US stock market and comprises 500 of the biggest companies in the US based on their market capitalizations. The fund aims to replicate the returns of the index by holding each stock in the same proportion as the index.

One of the biggest holdings of Vanguard 500 Index Fund (NYSE:VOO) is Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), a firm that markets electric vehicles and clean energy solutions. At the end of the fourth quarter of 2021, 91 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $12.9 billion in Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), compared to 60 in the previous quarter worth $10.6 billion.

Just like Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET), Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), and American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is one of the stocks that institutional investors are flocking to.

Here is what ClearBridge Investments had to say about Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:

“Within the growth universe we target, emerging growth stocks – the category with the highest revenue growth rates – significantly underperformed the overall growth categories in 2021 after leading performance in 2020. The pull-through effect on digitization, online access across industries, and spending to modernize outdated corporate infrastructures accelerated trends in a highly compressed time frame. Much of that trend slackened in 2021 and shares of these companies, while showing good top-line growth, saw slowing appreciation from the blistering pace in the prior year. With that moderating growth, multiples decelerated from 2020 highs. Bucking the headwinds among our emerging growth names was Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) which saw continued sales momentum from their leadership positions in the key growth areas of electric vehicles.”

9. Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (NYSE:RSP)

Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (NYSE:RSP) is an exchange traded fund that tracks the investment returns of the S&P 500 Equal Weight Index. The index comprises the same stocks as the S&P 500 Index but each is weighted equally to help with diversification. The fund invests at least 90% of assets in securities on the index.

A premier holding of Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (NYSE:RSP) is Paycom Software, Inc. (NYSE:PAYC), a firm that provides cloud-based human capital management solutions. At the end of the fourth quarter of 2021, 46 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $1.3 billion in Paycom Software, Inc. (NYSE:PAYC), compared to 40 in the previous quarter worth $1.4 billion.

In its Q3 2021 investor letter, Polen Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Paycom Software, Inc. (NYSE:PAYC) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:

“Our most significant detractors from performance over the fourth quarter includes Paycom Software, Inc. (NYSE:PAYC). Paycom Software, Inc. (NYSE:PAYC) underperformed, we believe, due to investor profit-taking following several months of solid performance. We remain positive on the long-term prospects of what we view as a great company.""

8. Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (NYSE:VTI)

Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (NYSE:VTI) is an exchange traded fund that invests at least 80% of net assets in securities on an index that comprises 100% of investable companies in the US stock market. The fund employs a sampling strategy to invest in securities on the index.

A key holding of the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (NYSE:VTI) is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), a firm that makes and sells consumer electronics. At the end of the fourth quarter of 2021, 134 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $186 billion in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), up from 120 in the previous quarter worth $146 billion.

In its Q4 2021 investor letter, Berkshire Hathaway highlighted a few stocks and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:

“Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) – our runner-up Giant as measured by its year end market value – is a different sort of holding. Here, our ownership is a mere 5.55%, up from 5.39% a year earlier. That increase sounds like small potatoes. But consider that each 0.1% of Apple’s 2021 earnings amounted to $100 million. We spent no Berkshire funds to gain our accretion. Apple’s repurchases did the job. It’s important to understand that only dividends from Apple are counted in the GAAP earnings Berkshire reports – and last year, Apple paid us $785 million of those. Yet our “share” of Apple’s earnings amounted to a staggering $5.6 billion. Much of what the company retained was used to repurchase Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares, an act we applaud. Tim Cook, Apple’s brilliant CEO, quite properly regards users of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) products as his first love, but all of his other constituencies benefit from Tim’s managerial touch as well.”

7. Vanguard Total World Stock Index Fund (NYSE:VT)

Vanguard Total World Stock Index Fund (NYSE:VT) is an exchange traded fund that invests in securities on the FTSE Global All Cap Index. The fund invests a majority of assets in securities on the index and also holds a representative sample of securities that resembles the full index.

Vanguard Total World Stock Index Fund (NYSE:VT) holds a large stake in JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), a financial services firm. Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Washington-based investment firm Fisher Asset Management is a leading shareholder in JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) with 7.4 million shares worth more than $1.1 billion.

In its Q4 2021 investor letter, Ariel Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:

“In our view, inflation will not just be a 2021 phenomenon. Inflationary expectations are only now working themselves into the labor market with historically low unemployment, resurgent labor unions, and higher wages. These labor cost pressures are only starting to show up in the Consumer Price Index. The most recent Producer Price Index showed a +9% year over year increase, the highest since it was created in 2010. Higher input prices generally lead to rising consumer prices.

“In our view, inflation will not just be a 2021 phenomenon.”

Consumer balance sheets are in excellent shape with lower unemployment and banked stimulus checks. A recent analysis from JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) showed average checking accounts have 50% higher balances than pre-Covid. The U.S. money supply as measured by M2 (a calculation that includes cash, checking accounts, and “near cash” such as money market securities) is up +38% versus year-end 2019. Higher consumer cash holdings and higher money supply mean more spending and demand for goods. Some emphasize supply issues to explain current inflation. Going forward, we see very strong demand as well, too much money chasing too few goods.”

6. Vanguard Dividend Appreciation Index Fund (NYSE:VIG)

Vanguard Dividend Appreciation Index Fund (NYSE:VIG) is an exchange traded fund that tracks the performance of an index which comprises the common stocks of companies that have a record of increasing dividends over time. The fund holds each stock in the same proportion as the weighting on the index.

Vanguard Dividend Appreciation Index Fund (NYSE:VIG) holds a large stake in Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), a Washington-based tech giant. Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Washington-based investment firm Fisher Asset Management is a leading shareholder in Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) with 26.8 million shares worth more than $9 billion.

In addition to Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET), Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), and American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the stocks that hedge funds are buying for long-term gains.

In its Q4 2021 investor letter, Vulcan Value Partners, an investment management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:

“Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) was a material contributor during the quarter. It is one of the highest quality companies in the world. We believe it has tremendous competitive advantages in its consumer and commercial Microsoft Office products as well as in its server and tools and Azure divisions. Over the last several years, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has been implementing a successful transition from a traditional software license and maintenance revenue model to a subscription revenue model. The company remains competitively entrenched, produces strong free cash flow, and has a strong balance sheet.”

485,2022-04-07T15:12:25+00:00,S&amp;P 500 companies get the most analyst Buy ratings in over a decade,"U.S. equity markets endured a gnarly first quarter.

All three major indexes logged their worst performance in two years as rising interest rates, geopolitical tensions and supply-chain disruptions dampened investor sentiment. But even against that backdrop, Wall Street pros stayed bullish on stocks.

According to new data from FactSet, analysts had the most Buy ratings on stocks in the S&P 500 as a percentage of their total ratings during February and March in over a decade. Of 10,821 ratings on companies tracked by the benchmark, 57.3% had an investment analyst recommendation to purchase their stock as of March 31, slightly trailing February at 57.4%.

Prior to the surge, the last time the percentage of Buy ratings exceeded 55% at the end of any month was September 2011, at 55.8%, the firm found.

The optimistic outlook was likely driven by an increase over the past several months in earnings estimates for S&P 500 companies, FactSet's John Butters points out. Although analysts have slightly tempered their expectations for first quarter earnings, the next three quarters look stronger for companies than strategists had previously anticipated. With high inflation bringing pricing power to firms, many companies in the index are expected to show double-digit revenue growth throughout 2022.

While analysts lowered bottom-up EPS estimates in aggregate for the first quarter (a 0.7% decrease from $52.21 to $51.83), from year-end 2021 through March 31, they lifted EPS forecasts for the second quarter by 1.6% from $55.16% to $56.07, by 2.4% from $57.82 to $59.23 for the third quarter, and by 3.9% from $58.31 to $60.59 for the fourth quarter.

Despite the downtick in estimates for the first three months of the year, with higher earnings outlooks for the remaining three quarters, analysts also raised EPS estimates for all of 2022 by 2.0% from $223.43 to $227.80.

John Hancock Investment Management Co-chief investment strategist Emily Roland told Yahoo Finance Live recently that the firm continues to see earnings growth estimates move higher over the next 12 months.""

“We know there are companies out there with solid operating leverage and great pricing power that have been able to expand their margins in this period of elevated inflation,” she said. “We’re going to see some pressure on margins, but the corporate fundamental backdrop is there.” A screen displays a stock chart at a work station on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., April 6, 2022. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid

Additionally, consensus analysts anticipate the S&P 500 will see a price increase of 16.8% to top the 5,000 level over the next 12 months based on the difference between the bottom-up target price and the closing price for the index as of March 24, per FactSet data. The bottom-up target price is calculated by aggregating median target price estimates for all companies (based on company-level estimates submitted by industry analysts). The bottom-up target price on the S&P 500 based on this computation was 5278.60, based on figures as of March 24, 16.8% above the closing price of 4520.16 that day.

Winners and losers

Looking at ratings at the sector level, stocks in the Energy, Information Technology, and Communication Services categories had the highest percentages of Buy ratings at the end of the quarter at 66%, 64%, and 62%, respectively, at the end of the quarter, according to the FactSet analysis.

On the contrary, the fewest Buy ratings were given to stocks in Consumer Staples at only 41%, and Utilities, at 49%, as of the end of March. The Consumer Staples sector also had the highest percentage of Hold ratings, 48%, and the highest percentage of Sell ratings, 11%.

At the company level, Signature Bank (SBNY) , Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE), and Assurant, Inc. (AIZ) had Buy ratings across the board at 100%. Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) followed suit at 98% for its Class C shares and 96% for its Class A shares. Buy ratings comprised 96% and 95%, respectively, of total analyst ratings on Amazon Inc. (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT).

The biggest loser in the category was Consolidated Edison (ED) with only 6% of its ratings reflecting analysts recommending buying the company’s stock, and Sell ratings representing 59%. Clorox Company (CLX) took second place on the lowest share of Buy ratings, at only 16%, and 53% recommending investors sell.

“In this environment, with valuation expansion potentially tough to come by due to rising interest rates and high inflation, earnings take on more importance,” said LPL Financial equity strategist Jeff Buchbinder in a recent note. “The good news is corporate America is in excellent shape — earnings estimates are higher in 2022 now than they were at the start of the year, which is no small feat.”

Consumers aren’t doing what they say they would do — and that’s a good thing for the U.S. economy and stocks, at least for now.

There’s a lingering disconnect between how consumers feel about their finances and rising inflation and how they're actually behaving, more specifically, spending

New proprietary data from the Bank of America Institute showed that spending on the bank’s credit and debit cards rose 11% year-over-year in March, and card spending per household was up 6.7% on an annual basis. The “hard data” reflects actual purchases as opposed to planned purchases (or lack thereof). And though some of this increase may reflect rising prices, the firm suggested purchase volume was still holding up.

“Consumers are facing headwinds from higher energy and food prices, with gas prices up almost 50% from a year ago,” said David Tinsley, senior economist for the Bank of America Institute, in a statement Wednesday. “But their balance sheets appear strong enough to weather the storm, provided it doesn’t persist too long.”

The data stands in contrast with what consumers are saying. In the “soft data” — or the qualitative measures of consumer sentiment and confidence — deterioration in the face of inflation has been much more prominent.

Perhaps one of the clearest examples has been in the University of Michigan’s closely watched Surveys of Consumers index, which fell to the lowest level since 2008 in March at 59.4. The survey respondents' commentary about their financial situations was abysmal.

“When asked to explain changes in their finances in their own words, more consumers mentioned reduced living standards due to rising inflation than any other time except during the two worst recessions in the past 50 years: from March 1979 to April 1981, and from May to October 2008,” said Richard Curtin, chief economist for the Surveys of Consumers, in the March 25 release. “Moreover, 32% of all consumers expected their overall financial position to worsen in the year ahead, the highest recorded level since the surveys started in the mid-1940s.”

Likewise, the Conference Board’s U.S. Consumer Confidence Index has continued to reflect confidence levels well below pre-pandemic averages. The headline index from this survey last ticked up to 107.2 in March from 105.7 in February, but still remained markedly depressed compared to the 2019 average of about 128.

While sentiment data serves as an indicator for how consumer spending may trend in the future, the measure has little impact on the economy. Droves of people are spending even if they say they want or plan to spend less.

Gross domestic product (GDP), or the main measure of economic growth, takes into account the hard data, and at least in the U.S. is composed primarily of consumption.

And when all is said and done, some of the hard data have been more equivocal about consumption trends. For instance, U.S. retail sales (reported by the Commerce Department) slowed to a 0.3% monthly clip in February, which marked the slowest rate since a 2.7% monthly decline in December. Retail sales were still up by 17.6% compared to the same month last year, however.

Meanwhile, real personal spending (which takes into account inflation) fell by 0.4% in February, suggesting rising prices were in fact taking a bite out of the amount of purchases, and especially in goods where real spending was down by 2.1%. But real services spending rose by the most since last July, increasing 0.6%.

All things considered, many economists have continued to highlight the strength of the U.S. consumer while adding a key caveat — spending could eventually slow down.

“The public is confident enough in the outlook to keep on spending to make the economy hum even if they tell pollsters they are vexed about higher prices,” Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS, wrote in a note last week. “The war in Europe and stock market volatility hasn’t hurt spending yet.”

487,2022-04-06T17:49:01+00:00,"Jobless claims preview: Another 200,000 Americans likely filed new claims","U.S. first-time unemployment claims are expected to come in around 200,000 yet again, with the rate of new layoffs and firings staying relatively low compared to pre-pandemic averages.

The Labor Department is set to release its latest weekly jobless claims report Thursday at 8:30 a.m. ET. Here are the main metrics expected from the print, compared to consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg:

Initial jobless claims, week ended April 2: 200,000 expected, 202,0000 during prior week Continuing claims, week ended March 26: 1.302 million expected, 1.307 million during prior week

If the figures come in as expected, the latest data would reflect a fourth straight week that new jobless claims were under 220,000 — or the approximate average rate that new claims were coming in per week throughout 2019. As recently as mid-March, new jobless claims dropped to their lowest since September 1969 at just 188,000.

Continuing claims are also expected to dip marginally in the latest data, setting a new multi-decade low of 1.302 million. During the prior week, continuing claims dipped to their lowest level since December 1969.

The latest weekly jobless claims data comes on the heels of another solid monthly jobs report from the Labor Department, which showed a significant rise in hirings and a drop in the jobless rate to a near 50-year low. Non-farm payrolls grew by 431,000 in March, while the unemployment rate improved by a greater-than-expected margin to 3.6%. And as of last month, the U.S. labor market was just about 1.6 million payrolls short of its pre-pandemic levels.

""No wonder inflation is out of control, the labor market is at full employment where the costs go up astronomically for companies to bring new workers in to run the factories and work the cash registers across the country,"" Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS, wrote in a note earlier this week. ""The cost of living crisis is aided and abetted by the worst labor shortage that America has ever faced. Waiting for more workers to join the labor force and 'participate' in order to bring down wages and inflation is a pipe dream.""

Story continues

The strong labor market has also emboldened the Federal Reserve to press ahead with more monetary policy tightening, including more aggressive interest rate hikes and balance sheet reduction process starting in the near-term. Earlier this week, Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard said it was ""of paramount importance"" to get inflation down, further reinforcing the central bank was committed to focusing monetary policy efforts on bringing down prices rather than optimizing for further employment growth in an already tight labor market.

""The labor market appears to be moving past the pandemic, rapidly closing in on a complete recovery,"" Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics, wrote in a note. ""Even as the labor market is tight, suggesting optimism about economic conditions, a four-decade high in prices is tempering expectations.""

""Even as consumer balance sheets are healthy and virus concerns are facing, there are downside risks that could weigh on household and economic activity more broadly going forward,"" she added.

488,2022-04-06T10:09:12+00:00,Here comes a stock market correction: strategist,"The markets could crumble under the weight of a series of rate hikes and nagging inflation well before the year ends, warns a top strategist.

""I do expect a market correction later on this year related to numbers [earnings],"" said 22V Research founder Dennis DeBusschere on Yahoo Finance Live. ""For now this is something not fully internalized by investors.""

DeBusschere expects ""violently flat"" returns for markets.

To Debusschere's point, markets have largely ignored any risk to corporate profits from inflation and higher rates.

The S&P 500 closed as low as 4,170.70 this year on March 8 as traders fretted about the aftershock of Russian's war on Ukraine, which included surging oil prices. But markets have since rallied hard — the S&P 500 is up 8% since those March 8 lows.

Stocks across sectors have rebounded, notably top tech names such as Meta (+15% in the past month) and Amazon (+12%).

Seasonal forces have also emboldened investors.

The S&P 500 has been green in April in 15 of the past 16 years, with an average return of 3.1% (the high was a 12.7% return in April 2020, and the low was a -0.7% dip in April 2012) according to data from LPL Financial's Ryan Detrick.

But, inflationary risks to corporate profits remain front and center and could begin to chip away at the bullish narrative in markets come earnings season later this month.

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 7.9% in February, marking the fastest pace of annual inflation in 40 years amid a push higher in rent, food and used car prices. Meanwhile, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index (PCE) rose 6.4% in February, accelerating from a 6.1% increase in January.

It represented the fastest rate of inflation since 1982.

The number of S&P 500 companies citing ""inflation"" on earnings calls has hit its highest level in 10 years, says FactSet.

As prices have climbed throughout the economy, the Federal Reserve has begun to hike interest rates to cool things down. The pace of rate hikes may be quicker than most market participants expect, as seen in the harsh reaction to stock prices Tuesday amid hawkish commentary from influential Fed Governor Lael Brainard.

Story continues

“Currently, inflation is much too high and is subject to upside risks,” Brainard said at a conference Tuesday. “The Committee is prepared to take stronger action if indicators of inflation and inflation expectations indicate that such action is warranted.”

Legendary investor and Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio warns the Federal Reserve is in a very tough spot, making the outlook for the markets uncertain.

""So what you have is an enough tightening by the Federal Reserve to deal with inflation adequately, and that is too much tightening for the markets and the economy. So the Fed is going to be in a very difficult place a year from now as inflation still remains high and it starts to pinch on both the markets and the economy,"" said Dalio in an interview with Yahoo Finance Presents.

489,2022-04-05T22:12:50+00:00,Stock market news live updates: Stock futures open slightly higher after tech sell-off,"U.S. stock futures traded slightly higher Tuesday evening as investors digested hawkish remarks from key monetary policymakers. These suggested that more members of the Federal Reserve were open to moving aggressively to raise interest rates and bring down demand and persistently elevated levels of inflation.

Contracts on the S&P 500 edged up. The blue-chip index ended Tuesday's session lower by 1.3%. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.3% its biggest decline in a month as technology stocks gave back some recent gains. The benchmark 10-year yield rose to top 2.55%, marking its highest level since May 2019.

More hawkish commentary from Federal Reserve officials knocked U.S. equities from their latest march higher and send Treasury yields spiking.

Namely, Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard said the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) was ""prepared to take stronger action"" should already elevated indicators of inflation rates and expectations warrant such moves.

Speaking in a webcast Tuesday, Brainard suggested this could include aggressive interest rate hikes and a much quicker drawdown of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet — which has thus far ballooned to nearly $9 trillion — than in previous periods.

""Given that the recovery has been considerably stronger and faster than in the previous cycle, I expect the balance sheet to shrink considerably more rapidly than in the previous recovery, with significantly larger caps and a much shorter period to phase in the maximum caps compared with 2017–19,"" Brainard said. She noted the process of reducing the Fed's balance sheet holdings, or beginning quantitative tightening, could begin as soon as the Fed's next meeting in May.

Other Fed members also suggested they were on board with more policy tightening in the near-term. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly told the Financial Times on Tuesday that the case for a 50 basis-point interest rate hike — or a hike double the size of the central bank's typical per-meeting increase — ""has grown.""

Story continues

“The fact is, the Fed has made it very clear ... it’s paramount that they go after inflation and do whatever it takes to staunch the rise in inflation,"" Quincy Krosby, chief equity strategist for LPL Financial, told Yahoo Finance Live. ""They’re going to do it, and I think the market is getting the sense that this is going to be a choppy path.""

""The Fed may go until it breaks something ... but it’s clear that this is their mission, and they are going to go ahead with it, full steam – more than 2017, more than 2018,"" she added, referring to the last time the Federal Reserve underwent quantitative tightening several years ago.

With inflation rates in the U.S. still holding at around 40-year highs and forcing the Fed's hand in aggressively tightening financial conditions, some on Wall Street have downgraded their expectations for U.S. and global growth. Deutsche Bank economists said Tuesday they expected the U.S. to tip into a recession at the end of next year as the Fed rapidly hikes rates to address high prices.

""We now expect the U.S. economy to be in outright recession by late next year, and the [Euro area] in a growth recession in 2024 with unemployment edging up,"" Deutsche Bank economists David Folkerts-Landau and Peter Hooper said. ""Our baseline view is that these developments will spill over to damp growth in much of the rest of the world and at the same time help to bring inflation back toward mandated levels, diminishing the risk of greater disruptions further down the road.""

Still, the economists noted their call for a recession next year ""is currently way out of consensus"" — and indeed, many on Wall Street still see a slowdown, but not necessarily a period of negative growth in the near-term domestically.

""We're not thinking that the Fed is going to push the economy into recession,"" Veronica Willis, Wells Fargo Investment Institute investment strategy analyst, told Yahoo Finance Live on Tuesday. ""I think most are not expecting that. But we are expecting kind of a slowdown in economic growth from what we had expected previously, but still around average economic growth here in the U.S.""

Video Transcript

BRAD SMITH: Welcome back to Yahoo Finance Live, everyone. You're watching with just minutes left in today's trading activity. Let's head on over to the YFi Interactive with Yahoo Finance's own Ines Ferre. Ines, what are we tracking?

INES FERRE: Well, Brad, we are just looking at the markets right now, near the lows of the session, as we go into these final minutes of trading. We're looking at the Dow that's down 8/10 of a percent. The NASDAQ composite down more than 2%, and the S&P 500 down more than 1%.

Looking at the sector action, we have seen consumer discretionary and technology really the laggards, losing the most right now. We're also looking at the NASDAQ 100. You can see on the left hand side of the screen, a lot of red there with the mega caps, and Tesla also lower.

And then looking at the travel stocks, we are watching right now, as we've been seeing, Spirit up 22%. Spirit was halted for new spending. And that would be that ""New York Times"" report that JetBlue is making an offer to buy Spirit for $3.6 billion. That's $33 a share, throwing a wrench, really, in plans for Spirit to merge with Frontier, another low cost carrier.

And then finally, just checking out the semis, those have been lower today. A lot of red there on the screen, as you see Nvidia down more than 5%. And the electric vehicle makers also lower. I mentioned Tesla, but all the other electric vehicle makers and automakers today lower.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/tech-sector-among-biggest-market-203126585.html,"['DJI.INDX', 'GSPC.INDX', 'IXIC.INDX', 'JAW.F', 'JBLU.MX', 'JBLU.US', 'NVD.F', 'NVD.XETRA', 'NVDA.MX', 'NVDA.US', 'NVDC34.SA', 'RUT.INDX', 'S64.F', 'SAVE.US']",[],"{'polarity': -0.214, 'neg': 0.043, 'neu': 0.914, 'pos': 0.043}"

Traditional stock trading firms and financial advisory services have lost a huge amount of business to online trading applications in recent years. The convenience factor of these online brokerages, alongside zero commissions or fees, have also made them hugely popular among a new generation of investors eager to get started at the stock market. Other benefits of using these online firms include robotic advisors, artificial intelligence-powered insights, and seamless networking. Robinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD) is one such trading app.

Robinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD) debuted at the market in the summer of 2021, raising close to $2 billion at the initial offering and was valued at around $32 billion at the end of the first day of trading. In 2021, the firm had more than 22 million active users. Even though the stock has lost value in the past few weeks as interest rates rise and push investors away from growth offerings, the developing economic conditions have also served to increase trades of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on the online app.

ETFs offer investors of all types certain advantages that include diversification, low fees, and trading flexibility. In an inflationary market, these advantages assume increased importance. The ETFs popular on the online stock trading application mirror the stocks popular on it. Some of the top holdings of the ETFs popular on Robinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD) presently include NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), and Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP), among others discussed in detail below.

ETFs Rising in Popularity Amid Market Volatility

There is tangible evidence supporting the claims that a rising number of investors now prefer ETFs over individual equities as the market becomes more volatile. In 2021, per data by financial services firm Morningstar, nearly $100 billion flowed into equity-based ETFs, up from $70 billion in the previous year. In early 2022, there were more than 490 equity ETFs that held $806 billion in assets. In 2016, these numbers had been 370 and $346 billion. According to Jay Jacobs, the head of research and strategy at fund management firm Global X ETFs, the pandemic has forced people to look for targeted exposures to the market, even within sectors.

Story continues

A new survey by investment banking firm Brown Brothers Harriman reveals that ETFs crossed a record $10 trillion in assets under management in 2021 and collected inflows of $1.2 trillion. US-based investors are leading this new bull market for the ETF industry. Nearly 84% of the institutional investors, fund managers, and financial advisors surveyed by Brown are looking to increase their ETF allocations in 2022, an increase of over 10% from the previous year. There is also a tilt towards actively-managed ETFs.

The survey further reveals that over 85% of US-based investors are looking to increase fixed income ETF allocations in the next year, an increase of nearly 20% compared to 2021. Some of the dominant themes expected to shape the industry moving forward include entertainment, aerospace, online retail, and energy production. Even as ETFs see record inflows, questions about the expense ratios of these ETFs and the management fees they charge remain a topic of intense debate.

Our Methodology

The ETFs listed below were picked based on the hype around them on stocks trading app Robinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD).

ETFs Popular on Robinhood

10. Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:VOO)

Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:VOO) is a fund that tracks the performance of the S&P 500 Index. The index comprises 500 of the largest firms in the US based on market capitalization. The fund holds each stock in almost the same proportion as its corresponding weightage on the index.

One of the biggest holdings of Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:VOO) is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), a diversified technology company headquartered in California. At the end of the fourth quarter of 2021, 134 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $186 billion in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), up from 120 in the previous quarter worth $146 billion.

Just like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), and Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the stocks popular on Robinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD).

In its Q4 2021 investor letter, Berkshire Hathaway highlighted a few stocks and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:

“Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) – our runner-up Giant as measured by its yearend market value – is a different sort of holding. Here, our ownership is a mere 5.55%, up from 5.39% a year earlier. That increase sounds like small potatoes. But consider that each 0.1% of Apple’s 2021 earnings amounted to $100 million. We spent no Berkshire funds to gain our accretion. Apple’s repurchases did the job. It’s important to understand that only dividends from Apple are counted in the GAAP earnings Berkshire reports – and last year, Apple paid us $785 million of those. Yet our “share” of Apple’s earnings amounted to a staggering $5.6 billion. Much of what the company retained was used to repurchase Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares, an act we applaud. Tim Cook, Apple’s brilliant CEO, quite properly regards users of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) products as his first love, but all of his other constituencies benefit from Tim’s managerial touch as well.”

9. SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY)

SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) is an exchange traded fund that tracks the investment returns of the S&P 500 Index which comprises a group of large-cap companies that trade on exchanges in the US. The weight of each stock in the fund corresponds to the weight of each stock in the underlying index.

A premier holding of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) is Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), a Washington-based tech giant. Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Washington-based investment firm Fisher Asset Management is a leading shareholder in Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) with 26 million shares worth more than $9 billion.

In its Q4 2021 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an investment management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:

“Despite these mixed emerging growth results, the ClearBridge Global Growth Strategy outperformed the benchmark due to resilience among our secular and structural growth holdings. The bulk of these contributions came from U.S. mega-cap growth stocks Apple and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) which continued to uniquely act both offensively and defensively as they have through most of the pandemic.”

8. ARK Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK)

ARK Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK) is an exchange traded fund that invests at least 65% of net assets in securities relevant to the disruptive innovation theme of the fund. The fund can invest in both domestic and foreign securities. The fund invests in developed as well as emerging markets. It is a non-diversified fund.

A key holding of the ARK Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK) is Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), an electric vehicle and clean energy firm led by eccentric billionaire Elon Musk. At the end of the fourth quarter of 2021, 91 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $12.9 billion in Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), up from 60 in the previous quarter worth $10.6 billion.

In its Q4 2021 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an investment management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:

“Within the growth universe we target, emerging growth stocks – the category with the highest revenue growth rates – significantly underperformed the overall growth categories in 2021 after leading performance in 2020. The pull-through effect on digitization, online access across industries, and spending to modernize outdated corporate infrastructures accelerated trends in a highly compressed time frame. Much of that trend slackened in 2021 and shares of these companies, while showing good top-line growth, saw slowing appreciation from the blistering pace in the prior year. With that moderating growth, multiples decelerated from 2020 highs. Bucking the headwinds among our emerging growth names was Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) which saw continued sales momentum from their leadership positions in the key growth areas of electric vehicles.”

7. Direxion Daily S&P Oil & Gas Exp. & Prod. Bull 2X Shares (NYSE:GUSH)

Direxion Daily S&P Oil & Gas Exp. & Prod. Bull 2X Shares (NYSE:GUSH) is an exchange traded fund that tracks the investment returns of a group of stocks from the oil and gas exploration and production sector. The fund invests at least 80% of net assets in these securities.

Direxion Daily S&P Oil & Gas Exp. & Prod. Bull 2X Shares (NYSE:GUSH) holds a large stake in Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), an independent energy firm. Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Florida-based investment firm GQG Partners is a leading shareholder in Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) with 14.5 million shares worth more than $638 million.

In addition to NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), and Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP), Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) is one of the stocks that retail traders on Robinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD) are buying.

In its Q4 2020 investor letter, GoodHaven Capital Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:

“After a rough start to the year our two biggest energy holdings – WPX Energy rebounded materially in the last six months though energy was still our biggest detractor for the year. I’ve previously written about deciding earlier this year to direct new capital towards better businesses versus adding more to the energy sector, but given the material optionality at WPX, we opted to maintain a material exposure. Recently WPX announced an all stock merger with a larger competitor – Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) – which will leave the new company with plenty of cash flow at lower oil prices, less leverage, and material upside to higher commodity prices.”

6. iShares Silver Trust (NYSE:SLV)

iShares Silver Trust (NYSE:SLV) is an exchange traded fund that tracks the price performance of the underlying holdings in the LMBA Silver Price. The fund has over $13.2 billion in assets under management and a YTD daily total return of 6.82%.

The holdings represent silver and come in handy as a hedge against inflation. JPMorgan is the custodian institution of the fund. The fund does not buy or sell silver to profit from the market price swings but does sell to cover operating expenses from time to time.

Contracts on the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial and Nasdaq Composite were near breakeven in extended trading after all three benchmarks closed in the green Monday. The Nasdaq — which gained 1.9% in the main session — was buoyed by a 27% surge in Twitter (TWTR) that came after Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk revealed he purchased a 9.2% stake in the social media company.

Musk is ""speaking with his money by saying that Twitter is an undervalued platform,"" MKM Partners' Rohit Kulkarni told Yahoo Finance Live. ""He sees there are things they can do to improve the service, and he's definitely hinting at a more active role.""

Wedbush Securities analyst and Tesla bull Dan Ives also told Yahoo Finance he predicts Musk will have an active stake in the social media platform over the coming weeks or months, and that his recent snap up of shares was “just the appetizer.”

Separately, Musk’s own company, electric-vehicle giant Tesla, contributed to the gains that propelled a take-off for tech during Monday’s trading session. Shares of the EV carmaker jumped nearly 6% after it reported vehicle delivery figures this weekend that came in higher than the same period last year.

Recession jitters were at bay on Monday after a closely-monitored portion of the Treasury yield curve inverted last week and spooked investors over the possibility of an imminent economic contraction. The phenomenon has a history of predicting a recession, with each of the last eight slowdowns dating back to 1969 preceded by a yield curve inversion. As of Monday morning, the yield on the benchmark 10-year note remained below that on the shorter-term 2-year note.

Still, worries about an economic downturn were not completely off the table for strategists.

Nomura Chief U.S. economist Robert Dent told Yahoo Finance Live he sees the potential for a ""mild recession""

Story continues

""We think that the cumulative risk of a recession between now and the end of 2024 stands at about 35% to 40%,” he said. “A lot of that is just coming from what we think is going to be this very aggressive response from the Fed to actually get inflation under control and make sure the labor market actually cools down.""

Uncertainty around the crisis in Eastern Europe also continues to be a headwind for investors. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon in his widely-read shareholder letter warned that the war in Ukraine is likely to meaningfully slow the U.S. and global economy. In the U.S. specifically, the bank estimates the U.S. economy will grow roughly 2.5%, a downgrade from the institution’s initial GDP forecast of 3%, with larger cuts to forecasts on Russia and Europe’s economic outlooks.

“We do not know what its outcome ultimately will be, but the hostilities in Ukraine and the sanctions on Russia are already having a substantial economic impact,” said Dimon, adding that “many more” sanctions could be imposed on Russia and spur further unpredictability.

The European Union addressed apparent war crimes in Ukraine on Monday, indicating in a statement that officials would, ""work on further sanctions against Russia” over the country’s targeted attacks on civilians. Some major European officials including Germany's defense minister said they would support banning Russian natural gas — a move previously excluded from sanctions as Russia supplies about 40% of Europe's gas energy.

497,2022-04-04T17:27:05+00:00,US could face a 'mild recession' in 2024: economist,"A recession is unlikely for 2022, but it's not 100% off the table, says one prominent Wall Street economist.

Nomura Chief U.S. economist Robert Dent told Yahoo Finance Live he sees the potential for a ""mild recession.""

""When we think of a mild recession I think the best example is probably what happened in 2021, maybe a 2 percentage point increase in the employment rate, a couple of quarters of weak GDP growth,"" Dent said. ""In terms of time willing, we are most concerned about potentially 2024. We think that the cumulative risk of a recession between now and the end of 2024 stands at about 35% to 40%. A lot of that is just coming from what we think is going to be this very aggressive response from the Fed to actually get inflation under control and make sure the labor market actually cools down.""

Dent thinks the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to 3.75% to 4% by July 2023. For 2022 and 2023, Dent sees U.S. real GDP rising 3.5% and 1.3%, respectively.

The task at the Fed to wrangle inflation is Herculean.

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 7.9% in February, marking the fastest pace of annual inflation in 40 years amid a push higher in rent, food and used car prices. Meanwhile, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index (PCE) rose 6.4% in February, accelerating from a 6.1% increase in January.

It represented the fastest rate of inflation since 1982.

Added Dent, ""We would largely agree that the inflation situation facing the Fed is quite a conundrum for them, and it will be difficult to navigate.""

Dent's sentiment dovetails with JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, who said in his annual shareholder letter on Monday the Fed is in a tough spot.

As prices have climbed throughout the economy, the Fed has begun to hike interest rates to cool things down. In turn, that has triggered a yield curve inversion and a groundswell of pros to express worry about a sharp economic slowdown this year.

Story continues

Bridgewater Associates Founder and Co-chief investment officer Ray Dalio stopped short of predicting a recession in an exclusive interview with Yahoo Finance. But, the billionaire investor is concerned about the pace of economic growth.

""I think that most likely what we're going to have is a period of stagflation. And then you have to understand how to build a portfolio that's balanced for that kind of an environment,"" Dalio said.

498,2022-04-04T13:11:53+00:00,JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon: Fed to hike rates 'higher than the markets expect',"The head of the largest U.S. bank said markets are underestimating the speed by which he expects the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.

In a letter to shareholders released Monday, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon added that short-term borrowing costs need to be “substantially” higher to address the rapid pace of price increases.

“The stronger the recovery, the higher the rates that follow (I believe that this could be significantly higher than the markets expect),” Dimon penned in the annual letter.

Dimon’s remarks suggest that the Fed could lift interest rates more than 2.50% this year, as some betting markets are pricing in.

High inflation and a strong labor market recovery pushed Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and his colleagues to pull back on the central bank’s extraordinary pandemic-era monetary stimulus. Beginning with the first post-COVID interest rate hike last month, the Fed is now in the early innings of an interest rate hike cycle that will likely include further interest rate hikes through the rest of 2022 — and likely beyond.

But it remains an open question as to how high the Fed needs to raise short-term interest rates (now in a target range of between 0.25% to 0.50%). There’s also the question of how fast the Fed needs to implement those rate hikes.

Several Fed officials are hinting that a double bump in interest rate hikes could be coming in future meetings. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, for example, told the Financial Times on Friday that she sees the case growing for a 0.50% interest rate increase in May.

The Fed has not raised interest rates in increments larger than 0.25% since 2000. Dimon said the Fed should be open to more aggressive moves if the data continues to show “unparalleled” inflation.

“One thing the Fed should do, and seems to have done, is to exempt themselves — give themselves ultimate flexibility — from the pattern of raising rates by only 25 basis points and doing so on a regular schedule,” Dimon said.

The Fed itself is projecting seven total rate hikes through the end of this year (to a target rate between 1.75% and 2.00%). Fed funds futures markets are pricing in odds of a more aggressive Fed (to a target rate between 2.5% and 2.75%).

The nation’s top banks stand to benefit from higher interest rates. Although JPMorgan Chase and the other large banks have managed strong profits despite rock-bottom interest rates, higher rates would allow banks to expand margins on their lending products (i.e. business loans, mortgages, credit cards).

In January, when the Fed was telegraphing fewer rate hikes than they are now, Dimon was similarly telegraphing that he could see the central bank moving faster than expected.

499,2022-04-04T11:49:28+00:00,Stock market news live updates: Stock futures edge higher as EU eyes more sanctions against Russia,"U.S. stock futures traded mostly higher Monday morning as investors monitored the potential for more sanctions against Russia amid ongoing concerns over inflation and global economic growth.

Contracts on the S&P 500 traded slightly higher as the index looked to hold onto last week's gains. The Dow was flat to slightly higher, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.4% as technology shares outperformed in pre-market trading. Shares of Twitter (TWTR) soared by more than 20% after Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk disclosed he now owns an about 9.2% stake of the social media company.

Investors globally considered the European Union's next punitive measures against Russia as the more than month-long war in Ukraine escalated further. The EU responded Monday to apparent war crimes in Ukraine, as Russian forces allegedly now widely killed civilians and attacked civilian infrastructure in major cities, with the bloc saying in a statement it would, ""as a matter of urgency, work on further sanctions against Russia."" Some major European officials including Germany's defense minister said they would support banning Russian natural gas — a move previously excluded from sanctions as Russia supplies about 40% of Europe's gas energy.

U.S. crude oil prices edged higher Monday morning and looked to rise for the first time in three sessions. Brent crude oil, the international standard, also gained.

JPMorgan (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon also called attention to the war in Ukraine as one of three key risks he saw to the economic outlook, according to his widely read annual shareholder letter released Monday. The other included ""the dramatic stimulus-fueled recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic"" as well as ""the likely need for rapidly raising rates and the required reversal of QE [quantitative easing]"" from the Federal Reserve, Dimon said.

""We do not know what its outcome ultimately will be, but the hostilities in Ukraine and the sanctions on Russia are already having a substantial economic impact. They have roiled global oil, commodity and agricultural markets,"" Dimon said. ""Our economists currently think that the euro area, highly dependent on Russia for oil and gas, will see GDP growth of roughly 2% in 2022, instead of the elevated 4.5% pace we had expected just six weeks ago. By contrast, they expect the U.S. economy to advance roughly 2.5% versus a previously estimated 3%.""

Story continues

Concerns over the resilience of the U.S. economy in the face of a geopolitical crisis and still-elevated inflation have been fanned further as a closely watched portion of the Treasury yield curve inverted — a move that previously has preceded recessions. As of Monday morning, the yield on the benchmark 10-year note remained below that on the shorter-term 2-year note. Such a phenomenon has occurred before each of the last eight recessions since 1969.

""Investors have been particularly concerned about the prospect of yield curve inversion as a signal for imminent recession,"" Goldman Sachs strategist David Kostin wrote in a note. ""Our rates strategists recently raised their forecasts and now expect the 2-year UST and 10-year UST yields to end 2022 at 2.9% and 2.7%, respectively, for a 20 bp [basis point] inversion.""

""However, our strategists note that the nominal curve tends to invert more easily in high inflation environments, which means that it would take a deeper nominal curve inversion than in recent cycles to produce a comparable recession signal,"" he added. ""Asset indicators imply a 38% probability of recession within 24 months.""
